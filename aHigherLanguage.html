<p class="scrollParagraph">I was walking in the woods and saw a path on my right. I had never seen this path before.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It was a few feet wide and a foot or two taller than me.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Branches on both sides had been pulled back and up, forming a pointed tunnel through the dense forest.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">On the ground, covering up the forest dirt was book after book, like someone had tiled a bathroom floor.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Curious, I started down the path.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The book path was flat like a road. It was easy to walk on.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At first it was a patchwork of hardcover and paperback.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then at points I found myself walking on magazines. Then newspapers. Then academic journals.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Eventually I was walking on screens, flashing moving images beneath my feet.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At first these things were only on the ground.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But soon they started to build up in layers along the sides of the path.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Eventually I walked between walls of books and papers and screens, walling me off from the forest.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Finally they began to arch overhead, and soon I found myself walking in a tunnel, brightly lit by screens.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Occasionally I would spot a hole where the forest poked through. I would stop and patch the gap.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By now my stomach was growling.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I reached into my pocket for a peanut butter sandwich I had packed long ago.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It had been so long that the sandwich had flattened into almost nothing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I couldn't figure out how to eat it or unflatten it, so I just pressed on.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I didn't notice the floor was vibrating until it was too late.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I realize now my body had sensed it. It was screaming at me to stop.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I was in too much of a hurry to see what the next walls had to say.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The last thing I remember is falling through the air on my stomach as a steep rocky cliff rushed by my feet and spinning around to see a tunnel of books and papers and screens rapidly disassembling above me in front of a bright blue sky.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I saw the previous end of the tunnel went to nowhere, over a void, and the new end of the tunnel ended at the edge of the cliff, coming out of the forest full of trees rising high into the sky.</p>
