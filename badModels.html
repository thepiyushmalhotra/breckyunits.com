<p class="scrollParagraph">We stood at the edge of the lake.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Everyone was in a wetsuit.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Except for me.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Wetsuits: <em>hundreds of people</em>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Boardshorts: <em>one person</em>.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"You're brave," another triathlete said.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I shrugged.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was not brave.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was dumb.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I did not think this through.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If I had done any research, I would have learned that the lake was 50 degrees.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If I had done any research, I would have learned that in 50 degree water, hypothermia sets in at 30 minutes.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I had one minute to think of a model and make a plan before the starter's gun went off.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>I've got it</em>, I thought.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>When I move, my body generates heat.</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>The cold will be painful.</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>Start slow.</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>Swimming will make me hot.</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>Then swim the second half faster.</em></p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>POWWW</em>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The gun boomed and hundreds of wetsuits dove in the water.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I dove in last, in my boardshorts, and started swimming slowly.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="dropcap">I am typing this story eleven years later. In warm clothes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And yet, I just felt shivers.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">As I learned that day, my model of the world was <strong>bad</strong>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Swimming generates heat, but in water that cold, you lose heat 10x faster than you make it.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="dropcap">Back in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Berryessa">Lake Berryessa</a>, things were not going as planned.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At the halfway buoy, I was struggling to control my limbs.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My teeth were chattering uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The only thing I had going for me was that my wiser, wetsuit-wearing friend Tom had slowed down, to make sure I stayed alive.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Knowing Tom was there to keep me from drowning, I flapped on.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After half an hour, I made it back to shore.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I had never been so cold.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was shaking so bad that it took me twelve attempts to lift my leg over my bikeseat for the next part of the race.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But...</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>I was alive!</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And I had learned an important lesson.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Bad models of the world can be dangerous.</strong></p>
