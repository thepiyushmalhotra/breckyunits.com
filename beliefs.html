<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 11, 2024 ‚Äî </span>What does it mean to say a person believes <em>X</em>, where <em>X</em> is a series of words?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This means that the person's brain has a neural weight wiring that not only can generate the phrase <em>X</em> and synonyms of <em>X</em>, but the wiring is strong enough to guide their actions. Those actions might include not only motor actions, but internal trainings of other neural wirings.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">However, just because a person is said to believe <em>X</em>, does not mean their actions will always adhere to the policy of <em>X</em>. That is because of <a href="brain-pilots.html">brain pilot switching</a>. The probability that any neural wiring will always be active and in control is always less than 1.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The strength of a belief is how often that neural wiring is active and guiding behavior and also a function of the number of other possible brain pilots in the population.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It seems brains can get into states where the threshold for a belief to become a brain pilot decreases, and lots of beliefs get a chance at piloting a brain during a period of rapid brain pilot switching.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For a belief to exist means it had to outcompete other potential beliefs for survival in a resource constrained environment and provide a positive benefit to its host. If a host had the ability to simply erase beliefs instantly, it seems like too many beneficial beliefs would disappear prematurely. So beliefs are hard to erase from a person's neural wirings. However, people could add a new neural wiring <em>NotX</em>, that represents the belief that <em>X</em> is not true. They can then reinforce this new neural wiring, and eventually change the probability so that they are far more likely to have the <em>NotX</em> wiring active versus the <em>X</em> wiring.</p>
