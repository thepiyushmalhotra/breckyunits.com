<p class="scrollParagraph">“Although it didn’t start out that way, The Daily Motivator is now my full-time job. Back in 1995 I started writing the messages as part of another website. Within a few months, the response was so positive that The Daily Motivator took on a life of its own.

<p class="scrollParagraph">Though a propensity for gossip typically motivates gossip bloggers, many are learning to cash in on their hobby. That’s what Lisa Sugar, 28, wants to do with her new blog, <a href="http://popsugar.com/">popsugar</a>, which has grown from 200 to 13,000 unique visitors a week since it appeared in March, according to the site. The self-described “media junkie” and Maryland native spends at least 40 hours a week researching and writing the blog on top of her full-time job as a media planner in San Francisco. <a href="http://lisaandbrian.com/index.php?p=95">[source]</a></p>
