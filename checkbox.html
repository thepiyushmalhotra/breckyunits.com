<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 25, 2024 ‚Äî </span>In 2013 my friends and I <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/07/05/political-blotter-kochs-liberty-hackathon-has-surprising-winner/">won the Liberty Hackathon in San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We built CheckBox, an open source system voting system that supported online, offline and hybrid elections. I did the technical design, Cam talked to users and developed the business pitch, and Ben provided the design.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">CheckBox built on our new discovery at the time, which now goes by the name Scroll Notation.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We tried (and failed) to raise money to work on CheckBox full-time.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We were quite poor at the time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I subsisted on an unhealthy diet of ramen and an occasional treat from the McDonalds $1 menu.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I often slept on a couch while hosting an AirBedAndBreakfast guest in my bed.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I also had a roommate and we had one bed and one couch in the room, and when our room wasn't rented we alternated who got the bed.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">About six months after this hackathon, Microsoft acqui-hired our team for <a href="https://breckyunits.com/nudgepad-an-ide-in-your-browser.html">NudgePad</a>, the other project we were working on.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This was great because I could now afford anything on the McDonalds menu.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Unfortunately CheckBox fell by the wayside, until someone reminded me of it today.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Below is our executive summary from our failed fundraising attempt in 2013.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">(I am still trying to find the code that powered our beta).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Although CheckBox as a business is not for me, I love the underlying CheckBox design, and still think that this system has a better underlying design than any other electronic voting system-by a wide margin.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The key idea is this: <strong>the underlying languages can power 100% digital election, 100% paper election, or a hybrid election</strong>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you want to build the best voting system, I am highly confident this is the way.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">CheckBox Executive Summary</h1>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Overview</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It‚Äôs 2013. Everyday we trust the Internet to process billions of dollars, keep our social security numbers secure, as well as our medical information. Yet still, to cast a vote we need to drive to a polling station, wait in line, and fill in bubbles with a pencil.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We‚Äôre changing that.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We built CheckBox so that voting districts can easily create a secure ballot for voters to vote from home.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Problem</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Online voting is a technical problem, not a political problem. No existing technology is able to provide a secure, user-friendly online voting experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Solution</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We invented the Space language (<em>2024 note: this is now called Scroll Notation</em>), which is the key technical innovation behind CheckBox. Space is the only language that is simple and powerful enough for online voting. </p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It offers:</p>
<ul ><li >Secure Voting</li>
<li >Private Ballots</li>
<li >Supports Electronic/Paper Hybrid Systems</li>
<li >Easy Customization</li>
<li >Supports Early or Absentee Voting</li>
<li >Election Auditing</li>
<li >Security Middleware</li>
<li >Registration and Ballot Distribution Middleware</li>
<li >Voter Registration</li>
<li >Open Source</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Prototype is live at <a href="http://getcheckbox.com" target="_blank">http://getcheckbox.com</a></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">How it Works</h1>
<ul ><li >Voters are provided a unique, random ID that qualifies them to vote, and a web address to access the ballot.</li>
<li >Voter cast their ballot with their random ID.</li>
<li >Raw results are published online after the election closes to verify legitimacy of election</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Distribution</h1>
<ul ><li >Reporters love writing about CheckBox. Our technology allows for new stories like analysis of actual raw ballot results.</li>
<li >Open source allows for easy ‚Äútry before you buy‚Äù compared to other competing solutions</li>
<li >Begin with private sector then sell to voting districts</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Traction</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We started working on CheckBox on June 21st. On June 22nd won the Liberty Hackathon Grand Prize ($3,000). On June 24th featured on NPR. Upcoming articles in Salon, BuzzFeed and Politico.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Business Model</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Free to self host and 10 cents per ballot for fully managed and hosted operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Government Market</h1>
<ul ><li >10,000+ election districts in U.S. ranging from 200 to millions of voters</li>
<li >$10 average cost per voter served. We‚Äôre going to charge $.10 per voter served</li>
<li >$700M TAM in the U.S.</li>
<li >Only 55% of eligible voters vote in the U.S. vote in a good year</li>
<li >32 U.S. states have applied for federal grant money to create online voting software</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Private Market</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Shareholder elections, corporate election, group elections, student elections</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Corporation</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We plan to incorporate as a for-benefit corporation in the State of California with a dual mission to maximize voter turnout and profit. Equity will be split as follows: Founders 60%, investors 20%, employees 20%. The company will be based in San Francisco and work from the Nudge Inc. office.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Milestones</h1>
<ul ><li >10,000 non-governmental elections conducted between now and November</li>
<li >10 municipalities deploy and use CheckBox in November 2013</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Deal</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We‚Äôre looking to raise up to $200,000 via convertible notes with an $800,000 cap to achieve our 2013 milestones.</p>
