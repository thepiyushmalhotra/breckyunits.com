<p class="scrollParagraph">I have used the same Gmail address as my main email for over 5 years. Since then:</p>
<ul ><li >I've made dozens of other emails that forward to this address.</li>
<li >I've signed up for hundreds of web apps and newsletters.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">As a result, my Gmail account gets inundated with email. Here are the stats:</p>
<ul ><li >16,054 unread emails in my inbox</li>
<li >29,236 emails total in my inbox</li>
<li >?? who knows how many total emails in my archive</li>
<li >3.683 GB of email</li>
<li >Using 49% of my Gmail quota</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My Gmail account had become a firehose.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This was bad for two reasons.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First, I started missing important emails. Not many, but a few per month. I had to write my own <a href="http://github.com/breck7/checkmygmail/">simple Bayes filter</a> to find them.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Second, I couldn't do what most people do: use my inbox as a "todo" list. Most people immediately archive or delete an email when they're done with it. This is a great organizational trick. I wanted to do this again.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I considered starting a new email address and giving it out to important people, but that seemed like it would make my life more complex.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">As it turns out, the solution was simple.</p>
<ul ><li >Started liberally using the "Spam" button. I started clicking Spam on pretty much any type of mass email that wasn't very interesting to me. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.</li>
<li >Starred all the recent messages that I still had to deal with.</li>
<li >Archived all 29,000+ of my gmail messages at once.</li>
<li >Went back to the starred folder and moved the important messages to inbox.</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>
<ol  start="1."><li >Thanks to this site for telling me how to <a href="http://www.supriyadisw.net/2008/04/how-to-archive-all-your-gmail-messages">archive all my gmail messages</a>.</li></ol>
