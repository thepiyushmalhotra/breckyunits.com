<p class="scrollParagraph">If you are new to version control, there are only 5 commands you need to memorize. Can you memorize 5 words? Of course you can.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So memorize these 5 words and you'll be practically an expert at version control:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">init
add
status
commit
push</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you just start playing around with these 5 and only these 5 commands, you'll become a git master in no time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here's a simple practice session you can follow to start getting good.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What is git?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Git is a simple command line program like "wget" or "vim" that you install and use by typing commands. If you don't have git installed, try one of these commands:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">yum install git-core
apt-get install git-core
sudo port install git-core</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's say you're creating a new website for your mom and want to use version control to do it.</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">mkdir moms_website
cd moms_website
git init</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This creates a git repository. Now type:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">ls -a</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Do you see the new ".git" directory? That's the git repository. It's basically a folder that stores the whole history of your project. Now, when you type a git command, it will do something with the files in that folder. That's all that's really going on. You never need to go into that folder manually, I was just explaining what git is doing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, let's create a file and add it to your repository.</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">vim index.php
Hello World
:wq
git status</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This will show the presence of an untracked file, "index.php". Let's add this file.</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">git add index.php</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You've now added the file to git, let's <strong>commit</strong> our changes.</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">git commit -m "first commit"</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now you've made your first commit.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The last command you'll need is <strong>push</strong>. It works like this:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">git push</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That will upload your repository to an online host like github so that other people can collaborate.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Create a github account and follow the instructions for creating a new repository to test out this final command.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That's it! Those are the 5 commands you'll use over and over again. Master those and slowly you'll start learning a few other helpful git commands.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Recap</h1>
