<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 28, 2010 ‚Äî </span>Competition and specialization are generally positive economics forces. What's interesting is that they are contradictory.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Competition</strong>. Company 1 and Company 2 both try to solve problem A. The competition will lead to a better outcome for the consumer.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Specialization</strong>. Company 1 focuses on problem A; Company 2 focuses on problem B. The specialization will lead to a better outcome for all because of phenomena like economies of scale and comparative advantage.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So which is better? Is it better to have everyone compete to solve a small number of problems or to have everyone specialize on a unique problem?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Well, you want both. If you have no competition, it's either because you've been able to create a nice monopolistic arrangement for yourself or it's because you're working on a problem no one cares about.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you have tons of competition, you're probably working on a problem that people care about but that is hard to make a profit in.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Update 8/6/2010</strong>: Overspecialization can be bad as well when things don't go according to plan, as NNT points out, <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/robustness.pdf">Mother Nature does not like overspecialization</a>, as it limits evolution and weakens the animals. If Intel fell into a sinkhole, we'd be screwed if it weren't for having a backup in AMD.</p>
