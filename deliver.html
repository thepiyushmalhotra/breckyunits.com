<blockquote class="scrollQuote">There's a man in the world who is never turned down, wherever he chances to stray;
he gets the glad hand in the populous town, or out where the farmers make hay;
he's greeted with pleasure on deserts of sand, and deep in the aisles of the woods;
wherever he goes there's the welcoming hand--he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods.

The failures of life sit around and complain; the gods haven't treated them white;
they've lost their umbrellas whenever there's rain, and they haven't their lanterns at night;
men tire of the failures who fill with their sighs the air of their own neighborhoods;
there's one who is greeted with love-lighted eyes--he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods.

One fellow is lazy, and watches the clock, and waits for the whistle to blow;
and one has a hammer, with which he will knock, and one tells a story of woe;
and one, if requested to travel a mile, will measure the perches and roods;
but one does his stunt with a whistle or smile--he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods.

One man is afraid that he'll labor too hard--the world isn't yearning for such;
and one man is always alert, on his guard, lest he put in a minute too much;
and one has a grouch or a temper that's bad, and one is a creature of moods;
so it's hey for the joyous and rollicking lad--for the One Who Delivers the Goods!

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 19, 2012 ‚Äî </span>For a long time I've believed that underpromising and overdelivering is a trait of successful businesses and people. So the past year I've been trying to overdeliver.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But lately I realized that you cannot try to overdeliver. All an individual can do is deliver, deliver, deliver. Delivering is a habit that you get into. Delivering is something you can do.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Overdelivering is only something a team can do. The only way to overdeliver, is for a team of people to constantly deliver things to each other, and then the group constantly delivers something to other people that that person could never imagine doing alone.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But in your role on a team, the key isn't to worry about overdelivering, just get in the habit of delivering.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Be the One who delivers the goods!</p>
