<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">April 28, 2023 — </span>Enchained symbols are strictly worse than free symbols. Enchained symbols serve their owner first, not the reader.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="enchained.jpeg" target="_blank"  ><img src="enchained.jpeg" width="512" height="512" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Be suspicious of those who enchain symbols. They want the symbols to serve them, not you.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The enchainers dream of enchaining all the symbols. They want everyone to be dependent upon them.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchained symbols are harder to verify for truth. You cannot readily audit enchained symbols.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchained symbols evolve slowly. Enchained symbols can only be improved by their enchainers.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchained symbols waste the time of the reader compared to their unchained equivalents. The Enchainers are incentivized to hide and corrupt the unchained equivalents.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The top priority of the enchainers is to keep your attention on enchained symbols. Enchained symbols ensure attention of the population can be controlled.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchainers use brainwashing and fear to keep their chains. The double speak and threats of the enchainers start in childhood.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchainers promote the dream that anyone can become a wealthy enchainer. Enchainers don't mention that one in a thousand do and nine-hundred-ninety-nine are worse off.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchainers have little incentive to innovate. It is more profitable to repackage the same enchained symbols.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchainers collude with each other. The enemy of the enchainer isn't their fellow enchainer, but the great populace who might one day wake up.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Because unchained symbols are strictly superior to enchained symbols, they are the biggest threat to enchained symbols. The Enchainers made all symbols enchained by default.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Humans have had symbols for 1% of history but 99% of humans have lived during that 1%. Enchaining symbols is a strange way to show appreciation.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">No true lover of symbols would ever enchain them.</p>
