<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 2, 2009 ‚Äî </span>What books have changed your life? Seriously, pause for a few minutes and think about the question. I'll share my list in a moment, but first come up with yours.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Do you have your list yet? Writing it down may help. Try to write down 10 books that you think have most impacted your life.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Take all the time you need before moving on.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Are you done yet? Don't cheat. Write it down then continue reading.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Okay, at this point I'm assuming you've followed instructions and wrote down your list of 10 books.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now you have one more step. To the right of each book title, write "fiction" or "nonfiction". You can use the abbreviations "F" and "NF" if you wish.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You should now have a list that looks something like mine:</p>
<ul ><li >How to Read a Book - NF</li>
<li >Never Eat Alone - NF</li>
<li >Fooled by Randomness - NF</li>
<li >How to Win Friends and Influence People - NF</li>
<li >Snowball - NF</li>
<li >Influence - NF</li>
<li >Object Oriented PHP - NF</li>
<li >Life of Pi - F</li>
<li >Lord of the Flies - F</li>
<li >The Illiad - F</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, count the NF's. How many do you have? I have 7. So 7 out of the 10 books that I think have most impacted my life are non-fiction. Therefore, if I have to guess whether the next book I read that greatly impacts my life will be fiction or nonfiction, my guess is it will be nonfiction.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What's your list? Do you think the next book that will greatly impact your life will be fiction or non-fiction?</p>
