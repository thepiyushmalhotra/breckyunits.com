</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 16, 2023 — </span>Over the past decade I discovered a language that is the minimal language needed to operate all government forms, all over the world. This language would work now, would have worked thousands of years ago, and could work thousands of years in the future.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Benefits</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In theory all government forms could shift to this model, and once a citizen learns this simple system, they would be able to understand how to work with government forms anywhere in the world.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This system could reduce the amount of time citizens waste on forms, reduce asymmetries between those who can afford form experts (accountants, lawyers, et cetera), and those who cannot, and increase transparency and reduce expense of governments.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Obstacles</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I will not make any claims that this system will catch on. Let's be generous and assume my system works as I claim. Even then, and even if 99% of citizens were better off, if the 1% of the population with power does not find this system in their interests, it is very plausible that it will not happen. In other words, it is a plausible argument that the current byzantine system strongly benefits those in the top 1% of society who derive revenue from this system, and can simply use a fraction of their dividend streams to have experts deal with these problems. So even if the system is significantly better for 99% of people, it could be worse for 1% of people, and it could be those people who decide what system to use, meaning this system might never take off.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Alternatively, if this system were to catch on, an unanticipated second order effect could be that by making government forms so easy and simple, more forms are created, reducing the net benefit of this system.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Obstacles aside, let me describe it anyway.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The System</h1>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Government Forms</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There are 3 key concepts to this system: Specifications, Instances, and Templates.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Specifications</strong> describe the fields of a form. For example, that it requires a name and a date and a signature. Every government form must have a Specification <span  class="scrollKatex">S</span> and every Specification must have an identifier. Specifications are written in a Specification Language <span  class="scrollKatex">L</span>. The Specification Language has a syntax <span  class="scrollKatex">X</span>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Instances</strong> are documents citizens submit that include the Specification identifier and contain a document written to that specification. Instances, <span  class="scrollKatex">I</span>, are written in the same syntax <span  class="scrollKatex">X</span> as Specifications <span  class="scrollKatex">S</span>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Templates</strong> can be any kind of document <span  class="scrollKatex">T</span> from which an instance <span  class="scrollKatex">I</span> of <span  class="scrollKatex">S</span> can be derived. Templates can follow any syntax.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Here's the Key Idea</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In this system, governments can provide Templates <span  class="scrollKatex">T</span> and citizens can submit them, as they do today, <strong><em>or</em></strong> they can directly submit an Instance <span  class="scrollKatex">I</span> for any and every Specification <span  class="scrollKatex">S</span>. In other words, Governments can still have fancy Templates for Birth Certificates or Titles or Taxes, but they <strong>also</strong> have to accept Instances <span  class="scrollKatex">I</span> for that Specification. Government archives would treat the instances <span  class="scrollKatex">I</span> as the source of truth, and the Templates <span  class="scrollKatex">T</span> would only serve as an optional artifact backing the <span  class="scrollKatex">I</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">The Syntax</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The syntax I have developed that is one candidate for <span  class="scrollKatex">X</span> for making this system work I call Tree Notation. There are no visible syntax characters in Tree Notation. It is merely the recognition that the grid of a spreadsheet and the concept of indentation is all the syntax needed to produce any Specification and any Instance ever needed. My syntax was inspired by languages like XML, JSON, and S-Expressions, but has the property that it is the most minimal—there is nothing left to take out, while still allowing the representation of any idea. I believe this mathematical minimalism makes it timeless and a good base for building a universal government form system.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">An Example</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A simple example is shown below. Despite the simplicity of the example, rest assured this system scales to handle even the most complex government forms and workflows. This system would work regardless of the character set or text direction of the language. The system works with both computers or pen & paper. This system does require a user friendly Specification Language <span  class="scrollKatex">L</span> to define the semantics available to the Specification writer, which could be created and iterated on as an open standard.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="govFormsExample.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="govFormsExample.png" width="2744" height="1432" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Conclusion</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This system is straightforward, future proof, works everywhere, and offers citizens worldwide a new universal user interface to their governments. It allows existing forms to co-exist as Templates but provides a new minimal and universal alternative.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I hope by publishing these ideas others might be encouraged to start developing these systems. I am hoping readers might alert me to locations where this kind of system is already in place. I am also keenly interested in mathematical arguments why this system should not exist universally.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="many-narratives-all-true.html">Many Narratives. All true.</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 13, 2023 — </span>I often write about the <a href="if-stories-are-lies-why-do-they-work.html">unreliability of narratives</a>. It is even worse than I thought. Trying to write a narrative of one's own life in the traditional way is impossible. I am writing a narrative of my past year and realized while there is a single thread about <strong>where</strong> my body was and <strong>what</strong> I was doing there are <em>multiple</em> independent threads explaining the <strong>why</strong>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Luckily I now know this is what the science predicts! Specifically, Marvin Minsky's <a href="marvin-minsky.html">Society of Mind model</a>.</p>
<div class="scrollKatex" id="2"></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Model</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You have a body <span  class="scrollKatex">B</span> and mind <span  class="scrollKatex">M</span> and inside your mind are a number of <em>neural agents</em> running simultaneously: <span  class="scrollKatex">M = \set{A_1, \mathellipsis, A_n}</span>. Let's say each agent has an activation energy and at any one moment the agent with the most activation energy gets to drive what your body <span  class="scrollKatex">B</span> does. It is very easy to see what your body does. But figuring out the why is harder, because we don't get to see which <span  class="scrollKatex">A_i</span> is in charge.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Easy to explain the <em>why</em> behind basic actions</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you eat some food, drink some water, or go pee, it can be easy to conclude that your "hunger agent", or "thirst agent", or "pee agent" was in charge.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Easy to explain the <em>why</em> when following orders</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you are following orders it can also be easy to explain the <em>why</em> because you can just say person Y told you to do X.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Harder to explain more interleaved threads</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When I am trying to explain actions across a longer time-frame it is more difficult. The agents in charge change.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Sometimes I take big risks and I can say "that's because I like taking big risks". Later I might be very cautious and I can say "that's because I am very cautious". This is a conflicting narrative.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The truth is I have agents that like risk, and I have agents that are very cautious. So the true narrative is "First, part of me, Risky Agent X, was in charge and so took those huge risks then later another part of me, Cautious Agent Y, took over and so that's why my behavior was very cautious".</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Access to information problem</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's also difficult to explain <em>why</em> you did something because your <em>Narrative Agents</em> don't necessarily have the necessary connections to figure it out. Minsky had the brilliant insight that a friend who observes you can often describe your <em>why</em> better than you. Your Narrative Agent that is currently trying to explain your <em>why</em> of an action might not have visibility of the agents that were in charge of the action, and so cannot possibly come up with the true explanation. But perhaps your friend observed all the agents in action and can tell a more accurate story. I try to have a couple of deep talks a day with friends, and besides just being fun, it is amazing how helpful that can be for understanding ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">"I" versus "Part of Me"</h2>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 9, 2023 — </span>When I was a kid we would drive up to New Hampshire and all the cars had license plates that said "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Free_or_Die">Live Free or Die</a>". As a kid this was scary. As an adult this is beautiful. In four words it communicates a vision for humanity that can last forever.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="nhLicensePlate.jpeg" target="_blank"  ><img src="nhLicensePlate.jpeg" width="320" height="156" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The tech industry right now is in a mad dash for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>. It seems the motto is <em>AGI or Die</em>. I guess this is the end vision of many leaders in tech.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">What should society prioritize?</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If <em>AGI or Die</em> is your motto freedom becomes a secondary consideration. Instead, we should optimize for whatever gets us fastest to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">Singularity</a>. Moore's law, the Internet, Wikipedia, all of these great advances have just been steps on the path to AGI, rather than tools that can help more people live free.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If <em>Live Free or Die</em> is your motto than people can still pursue AGI <strong>but</strong>...<em>we'll get there when we get there</em>. The more important thing is that we expand freedom along the way. Let's not make microslaves of children in the South so South San Francisco can move faster.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">AGI first, freedom second?</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps if the prime objective is for the most people to live free, then the most important thing they need is economic freedom, and AGI would in fact be the best path to get there. The only way for everyone to live free is to first build AGI. Work for the system now, and the system will give you your freedom later. I won't rule this model out but think there would have to be a lot of explanation on how the system would not renege on the deal. I also think there's a decent chance that an AGI arms race could lead to WWIII and a lot of people wouldn't make it.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Another argument that AGI is the best path to a free society may be that otherwise an autocracy might develop AGI first and conquer the free society. I think this would be a real threat but free societies could strategically challenge and liberate autocracies before they could develop an AGI.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">My preference: Live Free or Die. Maybe AGI.</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My oldest daughter used to admonish me "No phone dadda" and over a year ago, after my phone died in a water incident, I chose not to replace it. It's been an amazing thing and I feel like I am living more free. But I am no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">Luddite</a> (at least, not yet). I still spend a lot of time on my Macs. I love learning new math and science. I have no qualms against AGI or technology and I appreciate the benefits. I don't fear a singularity and think it would be cool if we get there someday. I just don't think AGI is the dominant term we should optimize for. If we reach the Singularity? Great. If not? No big deal. I believe living free is more important than life itself. (But maybe that's just because I saw a lot of license plates as a kid.)</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">May 19, 2023 — </span>There are tools of thought you can see: pen & paper, mathematical notation, computer aided design applications, programming languages, ... .</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And there are tools of thought you cannot see: walking, rigorous conversation, travel, real world adventures, showering, breathe & body work, ... <a href="#note2" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage2"><sup>^</sup></a>. I will write about two you cannot see: <strong>walking</strong> and <strong>mentors inside your head</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">On walking</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Walking is one of the more interesting invisible tools of thought. It seems it often helps me get <em>unstuck</em> on an idea. Or sometimes on a walk it will click that an idea I thought was done is missing a critical piece. Or I will realize that I had gotten the priorities of things wrong.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Why is walking so effective?</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My bet is it has something to do with <a href="marvin-minsky.html">neural agents</a>.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">Fatigue Theory</h3>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps it's a muscle fatigue phenomena. When you are working on an idea a few <em>active agents</em> in your brain have control. Those agents consist largely of neurons. Perhaps thousands of cells, perhaps many millions. Cells consume energy and create waste products. Perhaps like a muscle, the active agents become fatigued. Going for a walk hands control to other neural agents which allows the previously active agents to recuperate. After they are rested, they have a much better shot at solving the next piece of the puzzle.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">Change in Perspective Theory</h3>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Or perhaps it's a change in perspective phenomena. It's not that the active agents are fatigued, it's that they are indeed stuck in a maze with no feasible way out. The act of walking gives control to other agents, who may not have such a deep understanding of the problem at hand but have a different vantage point and can see an easy-to-verify but hard-to-mine path<a href="#note1" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Alternatively you could call this the "Alan Kay quote theory" after the quote which claims that a change in perspective can be worth as many as <em>eighty</em> IQ points.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">Connecting the Dots Theory</h3>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Going for a walk you see a large number of stimuli which perhaps cause many dormant agents in your brain to wake up. Some agents are required to solve a problem. Then on your walk at some point you come across a stimuli that wakes those required agents up. That is the epiphany moment.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Would this mean that browsing the web could have a similar effect? I could somewhat see that but I think a random walk on the web exposes you to junk stimuli that activates less helpful agents too, making it often a net negative. This might be easy to test: get subjects stuck on a problem then have them go on "walks" of various kinds (nature, city, book reading, web browsing, video games, ...) and measure the time to epiphany.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">No-op Theory</h3>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Or perhaps walking doesn't actually do anything and it's just a correlation illusion. Walking is simply an alternative way to pass the time until your subconscious cracks the problem. It may feel better when the solution comes to you while on a walk, even though the time elapsed was the same, because not only did you solve the problem but you also got some exercise.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="marvin-minsky.html">Marvin Minsky</a> mentions how he has "copies" of some of his friends inside his head, like the great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Dick Feynman</a>. Sometimes he would write an idea out and then "hear" Feynman say "What experiment would you do to test this?".</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When I stop to think, I realize I have some friends whose voices I can hear in my head. Friends who have a great habit of asking the probing questions, finding and speaking the best challenge, helping me do my best work.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Listening to certain podcasts—<a href="https://lexfridman.com/">Lex Fridman's</a> comes to mind—can have a similar effect. Though basic math shows it is an order of magnitude  more effective to find work  surrounded by people like this. It might take 10 hours of podcast listening to equate to 1 hour of real life back-and-forth with a smart mentor discussing ideas.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="marvin-minsky.html">The Magnificent Multi-Agent Mind of Marvin Minsky</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">May 9, 2023 — </span>If you want to understand the mind, start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a>. There are many people that claim to be experts on the brain, but I've found nearly all of them are unfamiliar with Minsky and his work. This would be like a biologist being unfamiliar with Charles Darwin.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">To be fair, there is a big difference between a biologist unaware of Darwin today versus back in the 1800's. It is a lot more forgivable to be unaware of Minsky today than it will be in fifty years. It takes time for the most enduring signals to stand out.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Only Way to Understand the Mind is to Build One</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Minsky had an extremely skeptical view of the fields of psychology and psychiatry. His approach to understand the mind was through attempting to build one. He conducted countless experiments to figure out the details, using crayfish claws, building the very first robots, and pioneering the field of software AI. The theories he developed from his play-like, bottom up, experimental approach I would personally bet will prove far more accurate and useful than all the theories from 20th century psychology and psychiatry combined.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="feynmanBlackboard.jpg" target="_blank"  ><img src="feynmanBlackboard.jpg" width="463" height="300" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">A well known Richard Feynman quote is "What I cannot create I do not understand." I wonder if Feynman's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKldGw7UXww">friend</a> Minsky inspired this quote.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Minsky mocked psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry with their chemical view of the brain. Imagine thinking you could fix a computer if you just adjusted the ratio of Copper-63 vs Copper-65 in the CPU. These people have no idea what they are doing or talking about, and Minsky called them on it. The thinking processes matter most, not the materials.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Basic Idea</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Minsky's view of the mind is one composed of a "<em>society</em> of tiny components that are themselves mindless". A person is a collection of agents, which are like programs and processes. Outputs from some agents may be inputs for others. Mathematically it could be modeled very roughly like this:</p>
<style>.scrollKatex {text-align: center; margin: 1em;}</style>
<div class="scrollKatex" id="55">Mind = P_{A_1} \circ P_{A_2} \circ \ldots \circ P_{A_N}</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Where <em>P</em> represents a running process of an agent and <em>N</em> is the number of agents that constitute a mind/person.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>N</em> might be very large. Minsky says hundreds in his talks, which might actually be a lower bound. If someone formed a new agent everyday, on average, it could be over ten thousand by the age of 30. If it took 1 million neurons to form one "agent" we could have 100,000 agents—the range of possibilities is large. Minsky's ideas are a conceptual framework, and it's up to science to figure out whether the agents model is correct and how many there might be<a href="#note1" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I don't want to use too much of your time to give you a second hand regurgitation of his ideas.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Suggested Reading (and watching)</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My goal with this post is to beg you, if you want to understand the mind, to start with Minsky. Pickup his book <em>Society of Mind</em>. I believe <em>Society of Mind</em> is the <em>Origin of Species</em> of our times. You cannot understand biology without modeling its evolutionary processes and you cannot understand the mind without modeling its multi-agent processes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Also get <em>The Emotion Machine</em>. There is a lot of overlap, but these are important enough ideas that it's good to see them from slightly different perspectives.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Alongside his books watch videos of him to get a fuller perspective on his ideas and life. There is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pb3z2w9gDg&t=4506s">MIT course</a> on OpenCourseWare. There's a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrmnH0xkzQ8">1990 interview</a>. And this 151 episode long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB2SsvcECzI&list=PLVV0r6CmEsFxJatFYBb7P4NZscvJw1f0r&index=1">playlist</a> will not only enlighten you about his ideas but entertain you with stories of Einstein, Shannon, Oppenheimer, McCarthy, Feynman and so many of the other great 20th century pioneers who were his contemporaries and colleagues.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Why are so many hogwash theories of the brain still dominant?</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In college I took some courses on the brain. This was in the 2000's at a "top" school. We covered the DSM but not Minsky. How could we not have covered Minsky? How could we have not talked about multi-agent systems? These are far better ideas.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My guess is financial pressures. As Sinclair wrote: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it." A lot of salaries depend not on having a better understanding of the brain, but on continuing business models based on flawed theories. I came across a great term the other day: the <a href="https://slowmission.com/healing-brokenness-and-the-mental-health-industrial-complex/">Mental Health Industrial Complex</a>. Though the theories these people have about the mind are not real, the money they earn from pills and "services" is very real-in the tens of billions a year. You might think that because these people have "licenses" their skills are not fraudulent. I'll point out that in Cambridge, MA, <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/iwantto/applyforafortunetellerslicense">licenses are also given to Fortune Tellers</a>.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A Solid Foundation</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Minsky certainly didn't figure it all out. You'll see in his interviews he is very clear about how much we don't understand and he talks about the future and what devices we need to figure out more of the puzzle. Researchers at places like <a href="https://www.numenta.com/resources/books/a-thousand-brains-by-jeff-hawkins/">Numenta</a> and <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink </a>continue down the path that Minsky started.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He didn't figure it all out but he certainly found a solid foundation. The people in computer science who took his ideas seriously are now building AIs that are indistinguishable from magic. Whereas the people in the mental health fields who have ignored his ideas in favor of the DSM continue to make things worse.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">April 28, 2023 — </span>Enchained symbols are strictly worse than free symbols. Enchained symbols serve their owner first, not the reader.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="enchained.jpeg" target="_blank"  ><img src="enchained.jpeg" width="512" height="512" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Be suspicious of those who enchain symbols. They want the symbols to serve them, not you.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The enchainers dream of enchaining all the symbols. They want everyone to be dependent upon them.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchained symbols are harder to verify for truth. You cannot readily audit enchained symbols.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchained symbols evolve slowly. Enchained symbols can only be improved by their enchainers.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchained symbols waste the time of the reader compared to their unchained equivalents. The Enchainers are incentivized to hide and corrupt the unchained equivalents.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The top priority of the enchainers is to keep your attention on enchained symbols. Enchained symbols ensure attention of the population can be controlled.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchainers use brainwashing and fear to keep their chains. The double speak and threats of the enchainers start in childhood.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchainers promote the dream that anyone can become a wealthy enchainer. Enchainers don't mention that one in a thousand do and nine-hundred-ninety-nine are worse off.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchainers have little incentive to innovate. It is more profitable to repackage the same enchained symbols.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enchainers collude with each other. The enemy of the enchainer isn't their fellow enchainer, but the great populace who might one day wake up.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Because unchained symbols are strictly superior to enchained symbols, they are the biggest threat to enchained symbols. The Enchainers made all symbols enchained by default.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Humans have had symbols for 1% of history but 99% of humans have lived during that 1%. Enchaining symbols is a strange way to show appreciation.</p>

</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 6, 2023 — </span>I believe Minsky's theory of the brain as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind">Society of Mind</a> is correct<a href="#note1" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage1"><sup>1</sup></a>. His theory implies there is no "I" but instead a collection of neural agents living together in a single brain. We all have agents capable of dishonesty—evolved, understandably, for survival—along with agents capable of acting with integrity. Inside our brains competing agents jockey for control.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I like to think the majority of agents in my own brain steer me to behave honestly. This wasn't always the case. As a kid in particular I was a rascal. I'd use my wits to gain short term rewards, like sneaking out, kissing the older girl, or getting free Taco Bell (and later, beer). But the truth would catch up to me, and my honest neural agents would retaliate on the dishonest ones.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've gotten more honest as I've gotten older but I have further to go. I'd love for my gravestone to read:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Here lies Breck.

Became an extraordinarily honest man.
Also for some reason founded FunnyTombstones.com</blockquote>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">How can I become more honest?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I am going to double down on something that has worked for me in my programming career: open source.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Becoming a more honest programmer</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My increasing honesty is evidenced in my code habits. I've gotten to the point where I'm writing almost exclusively open source code and data.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's futile to lie about open source projects. There are too many intricate details for a false narrative to account for. Not only can readers inspect and learn what a program does and how it works, but they can also inspect how it was built. The effort, time and resources it took. All the meandering wrong paths and long corrections. Who did what. The occasional times when something was done faster than promised, and the many times when forecasts were too optimistic.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My software products are imperfect. They always seem much worse to me than I know they can be. But they are honest, and one can see I am hellbent on making them better.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Closed sourced programs are like Instagram accounts</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">With closed source software one gets a shiny finished product without seeing any of the truth behind what it took to make. And almost always what people hide from you they will lie to you about.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The closed source software company is like the social media influencer who posts an amazing sunset shot of them in a bathing suit swimming next to dolphins. They will make it look effortless and hide from you the truth: the hundred less glamorous photos, the dozen excursions with no dolphins, and the intense workouts and hidden costs of their lifestyle. They will hide from you all the flaws. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">On social media this probably has minor consequences but in software eventually consumers are left increasingly paying the price for dishonest software. Technical debt accumulates in closed source projects and in the long run more honest approaches turn out to be better.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Applying the same open source strategy to the rest of my life</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Like my software projects, I don't have my life all figured out. I'm figuring it out and improving as I go. Stupidly, besides this blog I didn't do much in the way of open sourcing my life. I'm not talking about sharing glamour shots on Instaface. Instead I'm talking about <strong>open sourcing the plumbing: financials, health, legal contracts</strong>. The things people generally don't share, at least in my region of the world.</p>

Unfortunately, my wife was off in a suite with someone else, the marriage was not savable, and divorce is expensive<a href="#note2" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I thought my marriage was an edifice that would last forever. Instead it crumbled as quickly as an unstable building in an earthquake. In the rubble I found a gem: I now give zero fucks.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I am an 89 year old man in a 39 year old's body. I am not afraid of divorce. I am not afraid of public embarrassment. I am not afraid of financial ruin. I am not afraid of dishonest judges. I am not afraid of war. I am not afraid of death. I am now <a href="evie.png">bald Evie from V for Vendetta</a> except with a penis and far, far less attractive.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Things that people don't publish are the things they lie about. If I want to force myself into being extraordinarily honest, I need to take extraordinary steps. If I publish everything, then I can lie about nothing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I have the opportunity to open source my life. Not for attention or because I think other people will care, but because it will help me be a more honest me. I won't have to waste a second thinking about what to reveal to someone, or deciding whether to be coy. I will make it futile to lie about anything.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A Better Life</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In addition to keeping me honest, I see a lot of ways how open sourcing my life will have similar benefits to open sourcing my code. I can get more feedback, and collaborate with more people on new approaches to life.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I have a lot of ideas. I want to open source my net worth, income and expenses, assets, health information, and a lot more. There's a lot of opportunity to also build new languages to do so. I'm excited for the future. Time to get to work.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">2. SAFE from competition</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Traditional file systems make it easy to access, edit, and remix files in limitless ways. SafeFS provides a much simpler user experience by providing read-only access to files. Which apps are granted read-only access can also be controlled, further simplifying the user experience.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">In addition to the user experience benefits, this also ensures that businesses producing files are SAFE from increased competition.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">3. SAFE from costly bugs</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Software bugs traditionally cost businesses money. SafeFS flips that— turning what once were expensive bugs into lucrative revenue streams. SafeFS prevents consumers from making their own backups or sharing the files they purchased. Anytime they experience a bug that prevents them from accessing their purchased files they have no choice but to buy them again. In addition, businesses can use SAFEFS's remote bricking capabilities intentionally or unintentionally to keep revenue streams SAFE.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">4. SAFE from economic growth</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">SafeFS is the first file system proven to cause a slowdown in economic growth. SafeFS will cause countless hours of productive time to be wasted across all classes of builders: engineers, architects, scientists, construction workers, drivers, service workers, et cetera, ensuring progress does not go so fast that technology eliminates the need for lawyers, keeping legal jobs SAFE.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 3, 2023 — </span>Greater than 99% of the time symbols are read and written on surfaces with spines. You cannot get away from it. Yet still, amongst programming language designers there exists some sort of "spine blindness". They overlook the fact that no matter how perfect their language, it will always be read and written by humans on surfaces with spines, as surely as the sun rises. Why they would fight this and not embrace this is beyond me. Nature provides, man ignores.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="spines.jpg" target="_blank"  ><img src="spines.jpg" width="2048" height="1770" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">My M1 MacBook screen, paper notebook, notepads, and my 1920 copy of Einstein's Theory of Relativity, all have spines.</p></figcaption></figure>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">What does it mean for a language to "use the spine"?</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There are many other terms for <em>using the spine</em>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule">off-side rule</a>. <a href="https://pldb.com/posts/which-programming-languages-use-indentation.html">Semantic indentation</a>. Grid languages. Significant whitespace. I would define it as:</p>
</div>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">To use the spine is to recognize that all programs in your language will be read and written on surfaces with not only a horizontal but also a vertical axis—the spine—and thus you should design your language to exploit this free and guaranteed resource.</blockquote>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">The lessons from Positional Notation</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Over one thousand years ago humans started to catch on that you could <em>exploit the surface</em> that numbers were written on to represent infinite numbers with a finite amount of symbols. You define your base symbols and then use multiplication times position to generate endlessly large numbers. From this positional base, humans further created many clever editing and computational techniques. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation">Positional notation</a> languages would go on to dominate the number writing world.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Programming languages that use the spine are more successful</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Similarly, in programming languages we are now seeing more than 50% of programmers using languages that use the spine, even though languages of this kind make up fewer than 2% of all languages.</p>
</div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="spineGraph.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="spineGraph.png" width="1874" height="728" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">Data from <a href="https://pldb.com/docs/csv.html">PLDB.com</a> shows only 57 out of 4,228 computer languages use the spine. Less than 1.5%. Yet in that 1.5% are some of the most popular ones such as Python and YAML. This is probably signal.</p></figcaption></figure>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Spreadsheets use the spine</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When one expands one classification of programming languages to include spreadsheet languages, then the evidence is overwhelming: languages that use the spine are dominating. Excel and Google sheets famously have over 1 billion users and makes heavy use of the spine.</p>
</div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="explorer.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="explorer.png" width="2664" height="1604" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">Spreadsheets have used the spine and have over 1 billion users—orders of magnitude more than 1D programming languages.</p></figcaption></figure>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">At the dawn of a language revolution</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I firmly believe that this simple trick—using the spine—will unleash a wave of innovation that will eventually replace all top programming languages with better, more human friendly two dimensional ones. I already have dozens of tricks that I use in my daily programming world that exploit the fact that my languages use the spine. I expect innovative programmers will discover many many more. Good luck and have fun.</p>

</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Dozens of fields. Complex logic. Multiple pages. Client side and server side validation. Server side session storage. Helper routes. So much can go wrong!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So much to bill for! In my career I've been paid over a half million dollars to write web forms for Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Visa, PayPal, and many more. I've traveled the world off my web form earnings. Stayed in five star hotels. Flown first class. It's crazy—the worse the user experience, the more they pay me.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I try to argue for what users want: simple, fast, transparent, trustworthy, but no one listens. They are afraid to think different. No one understands language oriented programming. No one understands you don't ever need parentheses. No one wants to stray from the herd and be first.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">November 16, 2022 — </span>I dislike the term <em>first principles thinking</em>. It's vaguer than it needs to be. I present an alternate term: <strong>root thinking</strong>. It is shorter, more accurate, and contains a visual:</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Root thinking becomes more valuable as current growth slows</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Technology grows very fast along its trendy branches. But eventually growth slows: there are always ceilings to the current path.

</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Root thinking isn't as valuable when growth is rapid</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If everyone practiced <em>root thinking</em> all the time we would get nowhere. It's hard to know the limits to a current path without going down it. Perhaps we only need 1 in 100, perhaps even fewer, to research and reflect on the current path and see if we have some better choices. I haven't invested much thought yet to what the ideal ratio is, if there is even one.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">October 18, 2022 — </span>Austen James Heinz was probably the most brilliant, fearless, kind person I ever met. I met him twenty years ago, when I was 18, but it took me a long time to learn who he really was.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="austen.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="austen.png" width="859" height="572" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">Austen's response to my question "what are you up to this summer"? This was like 20 years ago, so go easy on him ;).</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Austen was called crazy by so many people. He's <em>bipolar</em>, was the most common "diagnosis". I'm sorry to say even one time I went to our Resident Advisor, to talk about Austen. Of course, me being stereotypically me, I didn't think Austen had to go to the hospital but instead I had a new idea on how the brain worked and an idea for how to control it better naturally that I thought might help him. I was told they knew of his condition and he was being taken care of. I wish I had just email pitched my ideas directly to Austen. Of course my neuroscience ideas at that time truly were dumb and uninformed and my later experiments would prove them wrong, but perhaps if I had just started the conversation with Austen about it we would have had an interesting fruitful collaboration.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Austen and I one time took a trip to Key West together for Spring Break. We were dirt broke, so we took the Greyhound bus from Durham, North Carolina, down to Key West. Nowadays I'm fat and lazy and often get bumped to first class, but I always get wistful about that bus ride. It was wild. The first segment did not have 2 seats together so we had to sit separately. Austen and I took 2 totally different approaches to deciding where to sit. I sought to sit next to the most normal looking person I could find. Austen never told me his strategy, but I swear to God he must have looked for whoever was talking to themselve and sat next to them. By the next stop Austen and his seatmate were best friends.  They smoked some cigarettes and I laughed listening to their conversation. Austen's seatmate told him he invented a device that was the size of a cell phone but instead of receiving calls blocked all nearby cell phones from getting signal. He said it was what kept the bus quiet. I don't know whether that guy was joking but he did sort of look like Albert Einstein so maybe not.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was thrown out of Duke University my sophomore year. This was a shock to me. It must have been because I didn't throwup that night freshman year. It was one of the first days of my second semester and suddenly everyone was doing fraternities. I did not know what a fraternity was. Nonetheless, before I knew it I was being herded into a dark room, then forced to chug a dozen cups of shitty warm beer that had been "sweetened" with heated mulled wine. There were thirty of us in that room and we weren't allowed to leave until the keg was kicked. Luckily there was a single wastebasket so there was a place for everyone to pee and puke and IIRC even one brave soul shit. Anyway, I refused to throw up because I don't like to throw up and fuck them. The next year Duke kicked me out because I "turned in a form too late", but I think I know the real reason. Some things I thought were orthogonal were not.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Being thrown out of college I followed a random walk and eventually I found myself working on some new movement related to a concept called "Intellectual Freedom". Austen was one of a cherished few people who supported me:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="austenMit.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="austenMit.png" width="924" height="236" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Of course, in that email Austen being Austen he also sent me an image of the fun he had been up to that summer (the image at the top of this post).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Austen was full of great ideas and amazing stories. He also seemed to be wierdly concerned with helping other people and protecting American values.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="austenAclu.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="austenAclu.png" width="1802" height="928" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I spent a year and a half away from Duke but eventually settled down and was allowed back in. It was a struggle to finish, but I did it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Before I graduated however, Austen planted a seed that would soon change my life forever:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="heinz101.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="heinz101.png" width="1246" height="660" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Eventually I did move out to San Francisco. Timing is a funny thing though. Austen left before I got there. And then in 2014, I left for Seattle, and Austen moved back.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I will never ever believe Austen killed himself. Austen was never crazy. Austen was intelligent, tough, gentle, brave, bold, hard working, loving, funny, kind. It's society who has been crazy. Maybe it's time more people took Heinz 101.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">October 7, 2022 — </span>In 2007 we came up with an idea for a scratch ticket that would give everyday Americans a positive expected value.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="seemewin.jpg" target="_blank"  ><img src="seemewin.jpg" width="1444" height="1078" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgG63QYZaE0">Still makes me laugh.</a></p></figcaption></figure>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Backstory</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In 2007 I cofounded a startup called SeeMeWin.com that combined 3 ideas that were hot at the time: Justin.TV, ESPN's WSOP, and the MillionDollarHomepage.com.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The idea was we would live stream a person(s) scratching scratch tickets until they won $1M live on the Internet.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I had done the math and knew all we had to do was sell ~$1.30 worth of ads for every $10 scratch ticket we scratched and we would make a lot of money.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Unfortunately this was before <a href="https://ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a> and <a href="https://abc.com/shows/shark-tank">Shark Tank</a>, and instead I literally was getting my business advice from the show <em>The Apprentice</em>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Needless to say I sucked at business and drove the startup into the ground.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">What I learned from our users</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When doing SeeMeWin, we developed a cult following. I thought that people would see our show, be entertained, and learn that scratch tickets are silly and make you lose money and put their money toward smarter investments. Instead, some people watched for hours on end, and we realized a lot of them were hard on their luck with gambling problems and needed help. My idea of teaching them something was stupid and not working. Could we come up with our own scratch ticket that was better than the competition?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The idea (patent not yet pending ;) )</h1>
</div></div>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Buy $100M worth of a random basket of public stocks. </li>
<li >Print $100M worth of scratch tickets where the winners get fractional shares of $90M of those stocks.</li>
<li >Adjust the variance so some tickets paid out big to keep it an exciting and fun gift and impulse purchase.</li>
<li >Use the $10M to pay ticket vendors, retailer commissions, and keep the rest as corporate profit.</li>
<li >An American's scratch off cards would have a positive expected value after less than 2 years based on historical stock market returns.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think it's still a great idea. I unfortunately was 23 and drove that business into the ground so someone else will have to do it.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">October 4, 2022 — </span>Every second your body makes 2.83 million new cells. If you studied <em>just one</em> of those cells from a single human—sequencing all the DNA, RNA, and proteins, you would generate more data than can fit in Google, Microsoft, and Amazon's datacenters combined. <strong>Cancer is an information problem</strong>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Mitosis refers to the process where a cell splits and takes about 2 hours. If you were building a startup and it was the fastest startup ever and your team doubled in size every month, you would be going at 0.0028 the speed of mitosis. <strong>Mitosis is very very fast</strong>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We think our information tools have gotten fast because we compare them to our old tools, but when we compare them to the challenge of mitosis and cancer they are slower than molasses.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Copyright laws have become <a href="https://breckyunits.com/an-unpopular-phrase.html">intellectual slavery</a>, and slow down our cancer researchers and healthcare workers to crawling speed. <strong>Because of our expanding copyright laws, our information tools are far too slow and as a result our cancer survival rates haven't budged in a century</strong>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We can either cure cancer or have copyright laws. We cannot do both. Mitosis is too fast and <strong>we need our information tools to be much, much <a href="https://breckyunits.com/how-the-public-domain-can-win.html">faster</a></strong>. We need them to be <a href="https://breckyunits.com/orders-of-magnitude.html">orders of magnitude</a> faster.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I can confidently make a prediction: <strong>if we pass an <a href="https://breckyunits.com/the-intellectual-freedom-amendment.html">amendment</a> ending copyright laws, we will see cancer fatality rates in the United States plummet by 50% within 2 years</strong>. I am willing to bet my <span class="scrollHoverNote" title="I am a bad bettor because I'm often wrong on timing—so let me be clear by "my entire net worth" I only refer to 50% of our family's assets—if I were to lose the bet I hope my wife will be my sugarmama.">entire net worth</span> on this.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Finally, a grim reality: though we will save hundreds of lives a day if we abolish copyright and build faster information tools, it will still take a far larger more Herculean effort to solve the toughest types of cancer. That will come down to the men and women in the white and blue uniforms in the hospitals and wet labs (I only know how to solve the bottlenecks in the dry labs).</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">September 1, 2022 — </span>There's a trend where people are publishing <em>real data first</em>, and then insights. Here is my data from angel investing:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="angelData.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="angelData.png" width="581" height="395" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">Sigh. I am sharing my data as a png. We need a beautiful plain text spreadsheet language.</p></figcaption></figure>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Bottom line</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I left my job at big company in 2016 and since then my average after tax annual take home has been $91,759. As you can see from my data, a single change could have dropped that to $0. I have worked at two non-profits since I left big company, so I have had other smaller sources of income. It was years before I get any return and there was a time where I thought I might go bust.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Dumb Luck</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At first I took myself seriously and thought I would be one of those smart "value add" investors. I am not. I have little idea what I'm doing. The one investment I made that did well pivoted to a very different idea than what they started with, in a domain I knew a lot less about. I sent them a lot of bad ideas. Luckily I don't think they followed any of them. At some point I changed my pitch to <em>I'll be there for the comic relief</em>.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Counting my blessings, moving on</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Last year I explored making a career of being a full time angel. I do love building things with great teams and it's fun to parallelize. But the pull from programming and science is too strong. I still will send bad ideas to the companies I invested in for many years, I hope, but going to keep this part-time. My focus is back to writing code. It's not good luck if you don't do something good with it.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Of course, there are a few exceptions here and there. I love sites like Angel List, WeFunder, Republic, et cetera, where I can make impulse investments and don't have to deal with useless forms. If there's one thing I hate, it's useless forms.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Gratitude</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Angel investing changed my life. Not just because of the returns, but for getting to witness deeply personal trials and tribulations from many entrepreneurs over many years. Although I personally didn't improve the trajectory of any of the companies I've worked with, they have improved my life. And they are all doing great things to improve the world. If you are a founder I invested in reading this: <em>thank you</em>.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">$5,000 investments</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I included only the investments I made where I wired $10,000 or more. That is 17. I made lots of smaller bets but those don't change the dataset much. My one piece of advice if you're getting in this game is to make as many investments as you can of small sizes to increase your learning rate.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 30, 2022 — </span>Public domain products are strictly superior to equivalent non-public domain alternatives by a significant margin on three dimensions: trust, speed, and cost to build. If enough capable people start building public domain products we can change the world.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It took me 18 years to figure this out. In 2004 I did what you would now call "first principles thinking" about copyright law. Even a dumb 20 year old college kid can deduce it's a <span class="scrollHoverNote" title="It retards the progress of arts and science, creates distrust, and increases inequality. ">bad system</span> and unethical. <em>I have to tell people so we can fix this</em>. I was naive. Thus began 18 years of failed strategies and tactics.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Trust</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You cannot trust non public domain information products. You can only make do. By definition, non public domain information products have a hidden agenda. The company or person embeds their interests into the symbols, and you are not free to change those embeddings. People who promote these products don't care if you spend your time with the right ideas. They want you to spend your time with THEIR version of the ideas. They will take the good ideas of someone like Aristotle and repackage them in their words (in a worse version), and try to manipulate you to spend time with THEIR version. They would rather you waste your time with their enchained versions, then have you access the superior liberated forms.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Speed</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Public domain products are <em>strictly</em> faster to use than non public domain products. Not just faster, orders of magnitude faster. You can deduce this for yourself. Pick any non public domain product. Now enumerate every possible way you might use that product. Write down a estimate of how long it would take you to do that task. Now pretend the author just announced the product is now public domain. Enumerate over your list again, again estimating the time it would take you to do each task. For some tasks that time estimate won't change, for many it will drop from hours to <em>instant</em>. For some it might drop from <em>years</em> to instant. For example, say the product is a newspaper article about some new government bill and your task is updating it with links to the actual bill on your government's website and then sharing that with friends—that task goes from something that may take <em>months</em> (getting permissions) to <em>instant</em>. When you sum the time savings across all possible use cases of all possible products, you'll see the <em>orders of magnitude</em> speed up caused by public domain products.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Cost to build</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Public domain products are far cheaper to build than non public domain products. Failure to embrace the public domain increases the cost to build any information product by at least an order of magnitude. This is because not only are most tasks a builder has to do sped up as explained above, but also because building for the public domain means you can immediately <em>build less</em>. For example, you don't have to spend a <em>single moment</em> investing in infrastructure to prevent your source code from leaking. Time and resources you are currently wasting on worthless tasks can be reallocated to building the parts of your product that matter.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Imagine that! You get to <em>do less</em>, <em>move faster</em>, and your products will be better and <em>trusted more</em>. I can't believe it took me so long to realize the overwhelming superiority of public domain products.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Rise of Public Domain Products</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite's</a> meteoric success is not a fluke. Public domain products dominate non public domain alternatives on trust and speed and cost to build. SQLite is <span class="scrollHoverNote" title="To be precise: SQLite is _one of_ the first.

But have you seen <em>Inside Out</em>? Amazing movie. It sticks with you. Makes you eager to spend $1,000 on a trip with your family to an <em>Inside Out</em> theme park. Money finds a way. Companies that engage in first principles thinking will also conclude that the math is clear: Public domain products are strictly superior to equivalent non-public domain alternatives by a significant margin on three dimensions: trust, speed, and cost to build.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Map chart slowdown</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the fall of 2020 users started reporting that our map charts had become slow.</p>
</div></div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="map-view.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="map-view.png" width="426" height="275" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">Suddenly these charts were taking a long time to render.</p></figcaption></figure>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">k-means was the culprit</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">To color our <span class="scrollHoverNote" title="The industry term for this kind of chart is Choropleth map. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">map charts</span> an engineer on our team utilized a very effective technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means clustering</a>, which would identify optimal clusters and assign a color to each. But recently our charts were using record amounts of data and k-means was getting slow. Using Chrome DevTools I was able to quickly determine the k-means function was causing the slowdown.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Benchmarking ckmeans</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We didn't write the k-means function ourselves, instead we used the function <code><a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/blob/master/src/ckmeans.js">ckmeans</a></code> from the widely-used package <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics">Simple Statistics</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My first naive thought was that I could just quickly write a better k-means function. It didn't take long to realize that was a non-trivial problem and should be a last resort.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My next move was to look closer at the open source implementation we were using. I learned the function was a Javascript port of an algorithm first introduced in a <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-2/RJournal_2011-2_Wang+Song.pdf">2011 paper</a> and the comments in the code claimed it ran in <code>O(nlog(n))</code> time. That didn't seem to match what we were seeing, so I decided to write a simple benchmark script.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Benchmarking shows closer to n² than n·log(n)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Indeed, my benchmark results indicated <code>ckmeans</code> was closer to the much slower <code>O(n²)</code> class than the claimed <code>O(n·log(n))</code> class.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Opening an issue</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After triple checking my logic, I created an <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/issues/520">issue</a> on the Simple Statistics repo with my benchmark script.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A fix!</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Mere hours later, I had one of the most delightful surprises in my coding career. A teammate had, unbeknownst to me, looked into the issue and <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/pull/521">found a fix</a>. Not just any fix, but a <em>3 character fix</em> that sped up our particular case by 20x!</p>
</div></div>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">Before:
if (iMax &lt; matrix.length - 1) {

After:
if (iMax &lt; matrix[0].length - 1) {</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He had read through the <a href="https://github.com/rocketrip/ckmeans/blob/49eb1bb9ca5467fdc153fe5d20f027ab7375c078/Ckmeans.1d.dp/src/Ckmeans.1d.dp.cpp">original ckmeans C++ implementation</a> and found a conditional where the C++ version had a <code>[0]</code> but the Javascript port did not. At runtime, <code>matrix.length</code> would generally be small, whereas <code>matrix[0].length</code> would be large. That if statement should have resolved to true most of the time, but was not in the Javascript version, since the Javascript code was missing the <code>[0]</code>. This led the Javascript version to run a loop a lot more times that were effectively no-ops.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was amazed by how fast he found that bug in code he had never seen before. I'm not sure if he read carefully through the original paper or came up with the clever debug strategy of "since this is a port, let's compare to the original, with a particular focus on the loops".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The typo fix made the Javascript version run in the claimed n·log(n) to match the C++ version. For our new map charts with tens of thousands of values this made a big difference.</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">Before xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 820ms
After  x 52ms</code>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Merged</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Very shortly after he submitted the fix, the <a href="https://github.com/tmcw">creator</a> of Simple Statistics reviewed and merged it in. We pulled the latest version and our maps were fast again. As a bonus, anyone else who uses the Simple Statistics ckmeans function now gets the faster version too.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Thanks!</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Thanks to Haizhou Wang, Mingzhou Song and Joe Song for the paper and fast k-means algorithm.

The biggest ideas, "upstream of everything", are at the bottom. The furthest upstream ideas we can never see. A better artist would have drawn this as an actual stream.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 28, 2022 — </span>There will always be truths upstream that we will never be able to see, that are far more important than anything we learn downstream. So devoting too much of your brain to rationality has diminishing returns, as at best your most scientific map of the universe will be perpetually vulnerable to irrelevance by a single missive from upstream.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Growing up I practiced Catholicism and think the practice was probably good for my mind. But as I practiced science and math and logic those growing networks in my brain would conflict with the established religious networks. After a while, in my brain, science vanquished religion.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I've seen now the folly of having a brain without a strong spiritual section.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In science we observe things, write down many observations, work out simpler models, and use those to predict and invent. But everything we observe comes downstream to us from some source that we cannot observe, model, or predict.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It is trivially easy to imagine some missive that comes from upstream that would change everything. We have many great stories imagining these sorts of events: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past">a message from aliens</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">a black cat</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show">a dropped boom mic</a>. Many ideas for what's upstream have been named and scholarized: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">solipsism</a>, a procedural generated universe, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">multiverse</a>, our reality is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World">drugged</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">the Singularity</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And you can easily string these together to see how there will always be an "upstream of everything". Imagine our lifetime is an eventful one. First, AGI appears. As we're grappling with that, we make contact with aliens, then while we're having tea with aliens (who luckily are peaceful in this scenario) some anomaly pops up and we all deduce this is just a computer simulated multiverse. The biggest revelation ever will always be vulnerable to an ever bigger revelation. There will always be ideas "upstream of everything".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you accept an upstream idea, you have to update a lot of downstream synapses. When you grok DNA, you have to add a lot of new mental modules or update existing networks to ensure they are compatible with how we know it works. You might have a lot of "well the thing I thought about B doesn't matter much anymore now given C". It takes a lot of mental work to rewire the brain, and requires some level of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So now, if you commit your full brain to science, you've got to keep yourself fully open to rewiring your brain as new evidence floats downstream. This might even be a problem if only high quality evidence and high quality theories floated by. But evidence is rarely so clear cut. And so you are constantly having to exert mental energy scanning for new true upstream ideas. And often ideas are promoted more for incentive rather than accuracy. And you will make mistakes and rewire your brain to a theory only to realize it was wrong. Or you might be in the middle of one rewiring and then have to start another. It seems a recipe for mental tumult.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Maybe, if there were any chance at all of ultimate success, it would make sense to dedicate every last 1% of the brain to the search for truth. But there's zero chance of success. The next bend also has a next bend. Therefore science will never be able to see beyond the next bend. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And so I've come full circle to realizing the benefits of spirituality. Of not committing one's full brain to the search for truth, to science, to reason. To grow a strong garden of spiritual strength in the brain. To regularly acknowledge and appreciate the unknowable, to build a part of the mind that can remain stable and above the fray amidst a predictable march of disorder in the "rational" part.</p>

<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Also related to neuroscience, I want to take a fresh look at differences in brains of those who cultivate spirituality and those who do not.</li></ul>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >I started this essay a while ago originally planning to write about how I <i>loved</i> mind expanding "upstream of everything" ideas like those at the center of The Matrix or Three Body Problem. Among other things, these ideas have airs of scientifically plausibility and they had a sort of anxiety-reducing affect: <i>who cares how the meeting goes if we're all just in a simulation anyway</i>? The neocortex could use these ideas to stop worrying. But then I realized that instead of cycling through an endless stream of plausible "what if" priors, it's a wiser strategy to go with spiritual practices refined by humans for centuries, where it's less about what specific idea is upstream of everything and more about acknowledging that there is something beyond the limits, making peace with that, maintaining a stable mind, and being part of a community.</li></ul>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >I've found too much time thinking about upstream ideas leaves not enough time to attend to downstream details.</li></ul>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >At one time I started collecting a list of all the upstream of everything ideas, like my tiny partial enumeration above where I mention The Matrix and Three Body Problem, and was thinking of the best way to catalog all of these ideas so one could grok them as fast as possible.

<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >I see myself fulfilling many common cliches (getting more religious as one gets older, et cetera).

<p class="scrollParagraph">The first implementation of Aftertext ships in the newest version of <a href="https://scroll.pub/">Scroll</a>. You can also play with it <a href="https://try.scroll.pub/#url%20https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breck7/breckyunits.com/main/aftertext.scroll">here</a>.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why did I make this?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First I should explicitly state that markup languages like HTML and Markdown with embedded markup are extremely popular and I will always support those as well. Aftertext is an independent addition. The design of Scroll as a collection of composable <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/blob/main/grammar/">grammar nodes</a> makes that true for all additions.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">With that disclaimer out of the way, I made Aftertext because I see two potential upsides of this kind of markup language. First is the orthogonality of text and markup for those that care about clean source. Second is a fun environment to evolve new markup tags.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Benefits of Keeping Text and Markup Separate</h2>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The most pressing need I had for Aftertext was importing blogs and books written by others into Scroll with the ability to postpone importing all markup. I import HTML blogs and books into Scroll for power reading. The source code with embedded markup is often messy. I don't always want to import the markup, but sometimes I do. Aftertext gives me a new trick where I can just copy the text, and add the markup later, if needed. Keeping text and markup separate is useful because <em>sometimes readers don't want the markup.</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It is likely a very small fraction of readers that would care about this, of course. But perhaps it would be a set of power users who could make good use of it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Speaking of power users, Aftertext might also be useful for tool builders. Imagine you are building a collaborative editor. With Aftertext, adding a link, bolding some text, adding a footnote, all are simple line insertions. It seems like Aftertext might be a nice simple core pattern for collaborative editing tools.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Version control tools are often line oriented. When markup and content are on the same line it's not as easy to see which changes were content related and which were markup related. In Aftertext, each markup change corresponds to a single changed line. In the future, I could imagine using AI writing assistants to add more links and enhancements to my posts while keeping the history of content lines untouched.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Finally, I should mention that it seems like keeping the written text and markup separate might make sense because it often matches the actual order in which writing text and marking up text happens. Writing is a human activity that goes back a thousand generations. Adding links is something only the current generations have done. A pattern I often find myself doing is: <em>write first; add links later</em>. Aftertext mirrors that behavior.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">A Petri dish for new markup ideas</h2>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Aftertext provides a scalable way to add new markup ideas. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Simple markups like bolds or italics aren't a big pain and conventions like <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italics</em> used in languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)">Textile</a> do a sufficient job. But even with those, after a certain amount of rules it's hard to keep track of what characters do what. You also have to worry about escaping rules. With Aftertext adding new markups does not increase the cognitive load on the writer.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you get to more advanced markup ideas, Aftertext gives each markup node it's own scope for advanced functionality while keeping the text text.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm particularly interested in exploring new ways to do footnotes, sparklines, definitions, highlights and comments. Basic Aftertext might not be compelling on its own, but maybe it will be a useful tool for evolving a new "killer markup".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Adding a new markup command is just a few <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/blob/main/grammar/aftertext.grammar">lines of code</a>.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What are the downsides of Aftertext?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There are downsides in using Aftertext that you don't have with paired delimiter markups.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There is the issue of <i>breakages</i> when editing Aftertext. The nice thing about <strong>bold</strong> is that if you change the text between the tags you don't break formatting. When editing Aftertext by hand when you change formatted text you break formatting and have to update those lines separately. I hit this a lot. Surprisingly it hasn't bothered me. Not yet, at least. I need to wait and see how it feels in a few months.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A similar issue to the breakage problem is <em>verbosity</em>. Embedded markup adds a constant number of bytes per tag but with Aftertext the bytes increase linearly with N, the size of the span you are marking up. Again, I haven't found this to be a problem yet. Perhaps the downside is outweighed by the helpful nudge toward brevity. Or maybe I just haven't used it enough yet to be annoyed. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Another problem of Aftertext is when markup is semantic and not just an augmentation. <code>*I* did not say that</code> is different from <code>I did not say *that*</code>. Without embedded markup in these situations meaning could be lost.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What are the problems with the initial implementation?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My first implementation leaves a lot of decisions still to make. Right now Aftertext is only usable in <code>aftertext</code> nodes. That is a footgun. The current implementation uses exact match string selectors that only format the first hit. Another footgun. I've already hit both of those. And at least two or three more.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Is this a bad idea?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You might make the argument that not just the implementation, but the idea itself should be abandoned.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The most likely reason why this is a bad idea is that it simply doesn't matter whether it's a good idea or not. You could argue that improvements to markup syntax are inconsequential. That even if it was a 2x better way to markup text for some use cases, AIs will change writing and code in so many bigger ways that's it not even worth thinking about clean source anymore. This could very well be true (luckily it didn't take many hours to build).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Or perhaps it is a bad idea because although it may be mildly useful <em>initially</em>, it is actually an anti-pattern and instead of scaling well, will lead to a Wild West of complex colliding markups. I generally don't have the mental capacity to think too many moves ahead. So I fallback to inching my way forward with code and relying on the feedback of others smarter than me to warn of unforeseen obstacles. </p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Summary and Closing Thoughts</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Markups on text may increase monotonically. With current patterns that means source will get messier and more complex. Aftertext is an alternative way to markup text which can scale while keeping source clean. Aftertext might be a good backend format for WYSIWYG GUIs. Though most humans write in WYSIWYG GUIs, Aftertext is designed for the small subset who prefer formats that are also maintainable by hand.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">In 1997 Ted Nelson proposed <a href="https://www.xml.com/pub/a/w3j/s3.nelson.html">parallel markup</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">The text and the markup are treated as separate parallel members, presumably (but not necessarily) in different files.
@ Ted Nelson</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When searching for '"parallel markup implementation"' I also came across a Wikipedia page titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_markup">Overlapping markup</a>, which contains a number of related points.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A couple of folks mentioned similarities to <a href="https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~ped/teachadmin/troff_intro.html">troff directives</a>. In a sense Aftertext is reimagining troff/<a href="https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/7-groff_man/">groff</a> 50 years later, when characters/bytes aren't so expensive anymore.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Brad Templeton describes two inventions, <a href="https://www.templetons.com/tech/proletext.html">Proletext</a> and <a href="https://www.templetons.com/tech/oob.html">OOB</a>, to solve what he termed "Out of band encoding for HTML". They seem <em>esolangy</em> now but actually cleverly useful back in the day when bytes and keystrokes were more expensive.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The Codex project has a related idea called <a href="https://zfdg.de/sb004_008#hd14">standoff properties</a>. As I understand it, the Codex version uses character indexes for selectors which requires tooling to be practical and rules out hand editing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://github.com/CondeNast/atjson">AtJSON</a> is a similar project and has clear documentation. AtJSON has a useful collection of markups evolved to support a large corpus of documents at CondeNast. AtJSON uses character indexes for selectors so hand editing is not practical.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why now?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Issues with embedded markup and alternative solutions have been discussed for decades. I would say it's a safe bet to say embedded markup is superior since it so thoroughly dominates usage. Nevertheless, as I mentioned in my use case, there is a time and a place for alternatives. Aftertext would have been simple enough to understand decades ago and use with pen and paper. So why hasn't Aftertext's been tried before?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Verbosity is certainly a reason. Bytes, bandwidth, and keystrokes (pre-autocomplete) used to be more expensive, so Aftertext would have been inefficient. It probably was worthwhile to have a learning curve and force users to memorize cryptic acronyms. It paid off to minimize keystrokes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I may also be overvaluing the importance of universal parsibility. I value formats that are easy to maintain by hand but also easy to write parsers for. Before GUIs, collaborative VCSs, IDEs, or AIs, there wasn't as much value to be gained by doing this. But even today I may be overvaluing hand editability. This seems to be the era of AIs and all apps editing JSON documents on the backend. I may be a dinosaur.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Finally, I may be overvaluing the clean scopes used by Aftertext provided by the underlying <a href="https://treenotation.org/">Tree Notation</a>. Aftertext works because each text block gets its own scope for markup directives and each markup directive gets <em>its own scope</em> and you don't have to worry about matching brackets. So maybe Aftertext just hasn't been tried because I overvalue that trick.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">October 15, 2021 — </span>I'm always trying to improve my writing. I want my writing to be more meaningful, clearer, more memorable, and shorter. I would also like to write faster.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That's a tall order and there aren't many shortcuts. But I think there is one simple shortcut, that I stumbled upon the past year:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Set your editor's column width very low</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">36 characters for me, YMMV. This simple mechanic has perhaps doubled my writing speed and quality.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At my current font-size, my laptop screen could easily support 180 characters across<a href="#monitorFootnote"></a>. But if my words spread across the full screen, I write slower and produce worse content.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Another way to frame this is my writing got worse as my screens got wider and I only recently noticed the correlation.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">How does column width affect writing speed?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When I am writing I am mostly reviewing. I type a word once. But my eyes see it fifty times. Maybe great writers can edit more in their heads. With my limited mental capabilities editing happens on the page. I do a little bit of writing; a lot of reviewing and deleting. So the time I spend writing is dominated by the time I spend reviewing. Reviewing is reading. To write faster, I need to read faster.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Humans read thinner columns faster. Perhaps this isn't the case for all people—I'm not an expert on what the full distribution looks like. But my claim is backed by a big dataset. I have my trusty copy of "The New York Times: The Complete Front Pages from 1851-2009". For over <span title="More than 50,000 days">150 years</span> the editors at the New York Times, the most widely read newspaper on the planet, decided on thin columns. If fatter columns were more readable we would have known by now.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Thinner columns help you read faster. Writing speed is dominated by reading speed. If you read faster, you write faster.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">How does column width affect writing quality?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Every word in a great piece of writing survived a brutal game of natural selection. Every review by the author was a chance for each word to be eliminated. The quality of the surviving words are a function of how many times they were reviewed. If the author reviews their writing more, then the words that survive should be fitter.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But moving your eyes takes work. It might not seem like a lot to the amateur but may make a huge difference toward the extremes. A great athlete practices their mechanics. They figure out how to get maximal output for minimal exertion. They "let the racket do the work". If you are moving your eyes more than you have to, you are wasting energy and will not have the stamina to review your writing enough. So thinner columns leave you with more energy for more editing passes. More editing passes improves quality.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">If column width has such a significant impact on writing speed, why have I not seen this stressed more?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I don't remember ever being told to use thinner columns when writing. In programming we often cap line length, but this is generally pitched for the benefit of future <em>readers</em>, not to help the authors at write time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I have long overlooked the benefit of thin columns at write time. How could I have overlooked this? Two obvious explanations come to mind.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First, I could be wrong. Maybe this is not a general rule. I have not yet done much research. Heck, I haven't even done careful examination of my own data. I've been writing with narrow columns for about 10 months. It <em>feels</em> impactful, but I could be overestimating its impact on my own writing speed.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Second, I could be ignorant. Maybe this is already talked about plenty. I would not be surprised if a <em>professional</em> writer sees this and says "duh". Maybe it's taught in some basic "writing mechanics 101" introductory course. Maybe if I got my MFA or went to journalism school or worked at a newspaper this is a basic thing. Maybe that's why journalists carry those thin notepads.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But let's say my hunches are correct, that thin columns do help you write faster and that this is not mentioned much. If I'm correct on both of those counts, then a clear explanation for this is that this simply is a new potential hazard created by new technology. My generation is the first to have access to big screens, and so in the past writing with wide columns wasn't a mistake people made because it simply wasn't possible. An alternative title I considered was "Write as fast as your grandparents by using the line length they used".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Jets are great, but beware jet lag when traveling. Big screens are great, but beware eye lag when writing. Try thin columns.</p>

<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >I wonder if sometimes over the years when I felt "in the zone" while writing, it may have been partly a result of coincidentally using a narrow column width.</li>
<li >I am a middling writer, so don't forget to weight this advice appropriately!</li>
<li >The physical dimensions of my writing area on screen are about 2.5 out of 11 inches. I've skimmed some studies that suggest 4 inches is the optimum for most people.</li>
<li >Some writing boxes never wrap, like Gmail. So to keep my columns thin I would manually insert line breaks. Manual line breaks were fragile for two reasons. First, when I revised the text I'd also have to revise the line breaks. Second, I coded the line breaks at <em>write time</em> with certain font and column settings. At <em>read time</em> those settings might differ. Multiple friends commented that I now wrote in haikus. I did consider for a moment that a reputation as someone who wrote only in haikus might be advantageous, but I ruled that out and stopped manual line breaks. Now I often write in Sublime Text and copy/paste into the target app.</li></ul>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><code>UserMethods</code> are all the entry points a user has to interact with your application. All interactions users have with your application can be represented by a sequence of calls to UserMethods.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">An Example</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's say I am writing a GUI email client application. I probably have an EmailClient class that can send an email, and then a "Send" Button. Using the UserMethod pattern I might have a private method perform the actual email sending work, and then I'd have a small UserMethod that the click on the button would call:</p>
</div></div>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">private _sendEmail():
  // ...

user sendEmailCommand(...):
  // ...
  this._sendEmail()</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That's it. In my pseudo code I used a "user" keyword to flag the UserMethod, but since most languages don't have such a keyword you can use either decorators or have an identifier convention that you reflect on.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Advice: When building applications, distinguish your UserMethods</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you are just building a library used by other programmers programmatically, then the public/private/protected access modifiers are likely sufficient. In those situations, your UserMethods are identical to your PublicMethods. But if there is a user facing component, some wisdom:</p>
</div>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">I have never seen a single application with a user facing component, whether it be a Graphical Interface, Command Line Interface, Voice Interface, et cetera, that doesn't benefit significantly from following the UserMethod Pattern.</blockquote>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Implementation Costs</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The UserMethod pattern costs close to zero. All you need to do is add a single token or bit to each UserMethod. It might cost less than zero, because adding these single flags can help you reduce cognitive load and build your app faster than if you didn't conceptualize things in this way.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Off the top of my head, I can't think of a language that has a built in primitive for it (please send an email or submit a PR with them, as I'm sure there are many), but it's easy to add by convention.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If your language supports decorators and you like them, you can create a decorator to tag your UserMethods. Without decorators, it's easy to do with a simple convention in any language with reflection. For example, sometimes in plain Javascript I will follow the convention of suffixing UserMethods with something like "UserMethod". (Note: In practice I use the suffix "Command" rather than "UserMethod", for aesthetics, but in this essay will stick to calling them the latter).</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Benefits</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By simply adding a flag to each UserMethod you've now prepped your application to be used in lots of new ways.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Benefit: New Interfaces</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By distinguishing my UserMethods, I've now done 80% of the leg work needed to support alternative interfaces—like command palettes, CLIs, keyboard shortcut interfaces, voice interfaces, context menus, et cetera. For example, by adding UserMethods to a component, I can then reflect and auto generate the context menu for that component:</p>
</div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="userMethods/contextMenu.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="userMethods/contextMenu.png" width="456" height="440" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've now also got the bulk of a CLI. I just take the user's first argument and see if there's a UserMethod with that name to call. The help screen in the CLI below is generated by iterating over the UserMethods:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="userMethods/cli.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="userMethods/cli.png" width="734" height="504" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For a command palette, you can reflect on your UserMethods and provide the user with auto-complete or a drop down list of available commands.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">With just a tiny extra bit of work—a single flag to distinguish UserMethods from PublicMethods, and a tiny bit of glue for each interface, you multiply the power of your application. The ROI on this pattern is extraordinary. It really is a rare gem. You do not see this kind of return often.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Benefit: Scriptability</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You've also now done the bulk of the work to make a high level scriptable language for your application. You've identified the core methods and a script can be as simple as a text sequence listing the methods to call, along with any user inputs. Your UserMethods are a DSL for your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Benefit: Scripted Regression Testing</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Your new UserMethod DSL can be very helpful when writing regression testing on situations a user ran into. A user's entire workflow can now be thought of as a sequence of UserMethod calls. You can log those and get automated repro steps. Or if logs are not available, you can listen to their case report and likely transcribe it into your UserMethod DSL. For example, below is a regression test to verify that a "Did You Mean" message appears after a sequence of user commands.</p>
</div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="userMethods/testing.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="userMethods/testing.png" width="638" height="186" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Benefit: As a Design Aide</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When ideating, it can be helpful to ask "what UserMethod(s) are we missing"?</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When editing, it is helpful to scan your entire UserMethod list and prune the commands that aren't popular or aren't needed, along with any resulting dead code.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Benefit: Rapid Prototyping</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Getting GUI's right can be challenging and time consuming. There are severe space constraints and changes can have significant ripple effects. You often do a lot of work to nail the visuals for a new component which then sees little usage in the wild. It can be helpful to build the UserMethod first, expose it in a Command Palette or via Keyboard Shortcut Interface, and only if it then proves to be useful, design it into the GUI. I guess if you wanted to be extremely cost conscious you could add UserMethods that simply alert a user to "Coming Soon" before you even decide to implement it.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Benefit: Documentation</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I find it helpful when reading application code to pay special attention to UserMethods. After all, these functions are why the application exists in the first place. That little extra flag provides a strong signal to the reader that these are key paths in an application.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Benefit: Analytics</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You can easily add analytics to your whole application once you've tagged your UserMethods. In the past I've done it simply by adding a single line of code to a UserMethod decorator.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Objections</h1>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Is this an original idea?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Heck no. I picked up this pattern years ago. Probably from colleagues, or books, or by reading other's code. I forget exactly how many times I've read about it, under what names. I'm sure there are thirty two existing names for this pattern. I'm sure 9 of those even have Wikipedia articles. But this pattern is so magical, so so so helpful, I do not think I will be wasting anyone's time by bringing it up again in my own terms.</p>
</div></div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've tried a lot of things, like having Command classes, or Application classes, and I've found the concept of function level UserMethods to be a killer pattern in my day-to-day work. You can always graduate to more fine separation later.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All that being said, I'm sure someone has written a much better piece that would jive better with my experience, and so would appreciate links to all related ideas. I'm always open to Pull Requests (or emails)!</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Shouldn't this level of abstraction be done at the class level and not method level?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Isn't it better instead to have an "Application" class, where all public methods are considered to be UserMethods? I won't argue against that. However, it's not always clear where to draw the lines, especially in the early days of a project, and it's much easier to build such classes later if you've clearly delinated your UserMethods along the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Aren't UserMethods just a subset of PublicMethods?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Yes. But they are a special category of PublicMethod and it's a distinction worth making. You want all your UserMethods available programmatically like the rest of your PublicMethods (for example, when writing tests), but you wouldn't want to show your users all PublicMethods in something like a Command Palette.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I salute you profoundly. Alexandra good afternoon.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Hello.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Please introduce yourself. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: My name is Alexander Elbakian. I am known as the creator of the pirate website.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Oh, we have never had a pirate like this before.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: What do you pirate?  </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Scientific articles. Well, generally speaking, when people talk about pirate websites, they usually mean some pirated movies or pirated music but very rarely do they talk about the fact that there's a lot of websites where they put free scientific literature which everyone can read and there are a lot of pirated and here is one of these websites is a Sci-Hub which I created</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: And what is in there?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, there is 85 million scientific papers  almost all of them in English. Really, well, English is now the international language of science so if you look at the popularity of this site, it has about half a million unique visitors every day.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: However, not the dumbest visitors </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yes, they are mostly scientists and students. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Technically, how is this organized?  Is it sitting in a basement somewhere and scanning scientific journals and then put them out  or  you can pull them up to you.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, technically, there's nothing being scanned. I mean, yes, there used to be a lot of pirate websites they work like that book websites that is where the user registering without uploading materials, well some books that they're like that it was especially widespread a long time ago that people scanned books and put them on the internet, now of course everything is in electronic form so pirated scientific literature is the most downloaded. I mean, it's already out there digitized. It is in its original digital form.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: It is like someone bought it and then starts  giving  it away . I guess so.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah, well, if you are talking specifically about the Sci - hub it's a little bit more complicated  it's connected to libraries at western universities and from there it downloads what's in those libraries and puts them in its databases just like that.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: And the libraries are free?  </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: If it's a library, for example, it's subscribed to some kind of scientific journal, then in that library has that journal available for free and if you try to for example to read it on the website the publisher's website then you have to each article there you have to pay for example 30-40 dollars and so on, but it's a very  a lot of money, so the need for such a website is very high. So you can enter to this website and those articles that cost 30-40 dollars there to read for free</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: It's on the site so there's no confusion. Here for example how to find it there the University of Massachusetts, but it's subscribed to some journal and if I go to the Massachusetts to the library there, can I read it for free?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, yeah.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: The articles that are on the  publisher's website sells for $30 one article.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well you can usually go to the library at Massachusetts University only if you're an employee or a student at that university. You need access to, like, the point of the Sci-Hub is is that this software that takes these accesses and there are a few hundreds of thousands and automatically  downloads it all from libraries. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: And what does the law say on that? Well, in our world of clean money, there's some kind of law that says you can't do that.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: of course the site has been repeatedly sued in various courts in different countries in the United States there in France in Austria in Italy in Russia so where else in the United Kingdom. And for example in United States the work of the site  officially banned by the court well the truth is there's still a lot of people from there use this website, in other countries access to the site is blocked at the ISP level like in Russia for example Roskomnadzor but still continues to work, something like this. I basically want to prove that it's all legal because it's more like illegal should be that the important scientific literature it's available  at such enormous prices. So it turns out that scientific knowledge they've become available only  to some elites and we would like it to be available to all the people.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: It's basically the system. I am not very knowledgeable but it seems to me that all textbooks they cost a hell of a lot of money, all the special literature costs a hell of a lot of money and everyone always explains it by the fact that they have exceptionally small print runs and they print on good paper there with graphics, illustrations, pictures and it's kind of expensive and that's why it's like this. But if it's thousands of dollars for one article it's crazy.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: you know, how are these articles basically what size can they be from, like, five up to 40 pages. the size of a scientific article. Well in principle here this problem is so acute that it's basically started to hinder the development of science itself. Well, it's the access to literature.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: With the advent of the internet, I think  the whole concept of copyrights has gone into. I think you just have to come at it from the other side, that is, if for this book that you printed on really good paper there with color illustrations and stuff that expensive if you do it all in electronically it's somehow a lot cheaper and the question comes back to my illiterate view in a different way that is if this one costs $30 and this one probably 30 cents should be at the racks. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: So it's in the electronic article  is $30, that's what I'm talking about. Yes, you can in principle now they have made that you can rent an article for example So it was a one day access. then for example it would cost 5 dollars and if you download the whole thing forever then it's 30 to 40 dollars and that's true.  Of course, and that's why a lot of people don't have access to the literature that you need right now a lot of scientists there are students, people who are doing professional science and  and it's not just there that this problem it's not just a problem in some poor countries but everywhere,  including abroad In the United States in general has been for a long time this problem has been discussed probably since the 90's and they've been tried to solve this problem,</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: and how they solve it</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: They solved it by, for example, creating special open access journals that work on the model that initially for the costs  of publishing the paper itself is covered by the author, as a rule, from the grant. That is, scientists do some kind of work they have a grant for example and part of this grant they keep the magazine and the magazine uses this money to, as it were posts an article and then that article  is available for everyone to read for free but they came up with this model when they were just starting the internet in the 90's they had a lot of idealistic scientists  in the West there was this dream that just everybody would start, well basically scientific journals and scientific publishing house they wouldn't need them,  I mean scientists they would start to put all their works and they'll be free to read that one. But despite the fact that such websites like archive.org have appeared in general as if there's some kind of global change it didn't lead to that. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Why? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, that is because, you know when papers are published in some famous journal, then it turns out that a scientist gets recognition if you just put the work on your website then anybody can do that and this way it turns out that if it's published somewhere,  then it's passed some kind of filter  and so in your career this article will be taken into account. It is like this.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: On the one hand, it makes sense, of course. There must be some kind of, I don't know, scientific board. editorial board should be absolutely. But again, if you make money from this, but we have capitalism and they make money then with a different model, so to speak. you have a circulation let's say a book of 5000 and here 500 electronically and if you're selling for $30 here and here for 30 cents, then 500 is much it's more important that you can make more money you can make more money online what's the point it's just until it breaks. I remember when up until relatively recently somewhere in the early 2000's Stephen King a famous writer, he decided to publish his book that the publishers were getting fed up with it. He thought of all this a long time ago, but after a while time Steven King gave up because at that time the cash change system wasn't worked out and even such a mega popular author  it didn't work out and now for example a lot of authors with selling e-books get a lot more exactly a lot more than selling paper books and a lot of authors don't sell paper books at all  because publishing online is much more profitable and what's stopping them? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well a paper book they in principle is nice purely as a the subject there are beautiful pages and so further. Well what is its value of a paper book right now?</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: (🕰10:00) Purely for work, of course they're inconvenient and and it's a nonsense to scribble something with a fountain pen to write something out is nonsense and for searching anything with a fountain pen is totally unusable. So what, Why don't they want to do it?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Why don't science publishers want to sell everything cheaper? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Yeah. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, that is probably more of a question to them, but the thing is if you look at the history  of this issue, somewhere in the twentieth century, back in the scientific journals they were sort of published by the scientific communities and mostly on a non-profit basis and towards the end of the twentieth century started to be bought up outright by these large commercial scientific publishers and now there's  this kind of oligopoly  There are some big publishers out there, like  Elsevier, Springer, Wale, and others that they sort of kind of own almost all of the scientific communication between scientists, and so  after they became owners of these scientific journals, they started very sharply raise on them. So in the graphs the price increases for scientific journals was several times higher than inflation.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I'm sorry to interrupt, maybe this is some kind of political bullshit that is conventionally the United States government is categorically not interested in having Chinese universities, Indian universities,  I don't know Malay take this for free and and use it. That is when you are going to have scientists and we won't have enough and that's why we're going to screw up the price and cut you off that way. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well that might actually happen  because again if you look at this history of how this open science movement developed. That is, yes, when it became obvious that this problem with high prices and in basically not only in China, well it was written that even the richest universities in the richest countries have they had serious problems with to buy magazines and there one magazine subscription it can cost a few thousand dollars a year. In these magazines there are many thousands of them,  so it turns out that by the early of the 2000's there's a movement in science to a Western movement for open access, you know. or open science which means stands for the fact that there's a whole this whole exchange of scientific information between scientists so that it would be completely free without any economic barriers. But if you look at the principle the term open science itself when it the first time it appears, it's somewhere in the '80s and there are some articles in there that talk specifically about the commercialization of science and there are some that talk about that the Pentagon somehow forbids, you know, in universities in the U.S. somehow it's free there to publish something free rules to hold conferences and that's why scientists they're advocating that everything should be open and that it doesn't really it doesn't really have any effect on the security country. But  if we talk about the Soviet Union  that was still then the Soviet Union it will steal sooner or later anyway and if you kind of shut everything down like this the exchange of scientific information then it would just it's just going to hurt science itself, i.e. science itself it will not be able to develop quickly.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: It can't exist apart from politics if it's like the famous Manhattan project when the Americans were building the atomic bomb and the Bolsheviks allegedly stole it and as it turns out in the games they didn't steal anything. and those who created the Manhattan Project Manhattan Project and those who worked on it knowing what kind of degenerates you are at the helm of the United States as people who are  intellectually gifted, you can't to have something like that on your own. They purposefully leaked it to the Bolsheviks. And they weren't leaking secrets, they were explaining in which directions they shouldn't work that they had already worked on this super fictitious, you have to dig here so who stole from whom is somehow who stole who is suspicious. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well in general the American PR machine is very powerful and that is why  of course any developments they as their own or something that was stolen from them. in my opinion.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: That is, their economic well-being rests solely on military power so the military, so I can't say that they're getting into science they live off of it I mean the defense of the country is based on science. Naturally, they will not allow the secrecy not let them raise the price of something else. If you give it to everyone you will destroy all the competitive advantages and  where will the money come from then that is this political bullshit is fine. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: But it's just that in publications from the '80s. you can find  echoes of this conflict between  scientists in the United States and the Pentagon and that the Pentagon was trying to sort of forbid it and they objected by saying that if like a secret, then science just wouldn't develop quickly that science is sort of based on the common ownership of the results of scientific knowledge and science  is based on free communication. That is, and in those branches of  of science where communication, the exchange of scientific results are the most rapid and freely those and develop much faster.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Well, it depends on what kind of science if I do not know Shakespeare's work or Homer's work it's understandable that no one needs it, but if it's about war and advanced technology like that and  I don't know if there are bans on for example selling technology to the soviet union like the Jacksons amendment where there's – “but you can't” I remember there were wild hysteria when Toshiba sold some milling machines that the Bolsheviks immediately started to turn special propellers for submarines. And the submarines were no longer heard in the ocean and that poor Toshiba was being robbed there and just all voices of America. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: I remember a company like that.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: They were choking on what the Bolsheviks there had sold that they weren't allowed to sell and if the results of scientific research to put out like this then the insidious Chinese Bolsheviks will look at it and start making the chips themselves and through that they will start for example they'll start building some kind of powerful computing machines that with China's money they'll immediately  to outrun the United States. They will start simulating nuclear explosions and then the the U.S. is nowhere and money will be taken away from everyone, everything will be forbid .It is impossible to allow it open. I suspect scientists are some kind of crypto Bolsheviks they think that there are no states no contradictions between states let's give them all away so it doesn't happen</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: The point is that collectivism and communism is kind of at the core of science</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D:  actually  all the scientists there are leftists.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, basically the theory is that like after that the Soviet Union collapsed  the Pentagon probably lost the ability to say that they had to keep everything secret so that they wouldn't play the soviet union and probably decided then to put an economic barrier  I mean maybe that is the version or maybe it's just some kind of unprecedented greed of scientific of publishing. Of course, they just want  to make more profit if they can do it, but that's what it leads to such results</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I used to be deep into computer games like the way movies are in music there are a number of citizens in the west who are just like these scientists they think that all information  should be distributed for free and be available to everyone, so here are  the creators of the toy built their toy working out there for two years for monstrous money and stuff. They brought the disk to the factory  and says that it needs to be printed Then  guys put it in the computer one way so to speak they make an image and then they start printing and before the disks ready to go out of the factory they put it all on the websites for free. So they do it for free. they're doing it for free and they're not make a profit. Then they start screaming that look at all the Russian pirates  locked up in the U.S. Let's start from here and your Russians they printed here stolen there and sell it, that's the point. Well, you don't sell other people's notes, do you? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: No, if we're talking about differences for example a computer industry with science, the thing about science is that the authors don't get any money at all from the sale of these articles absolutely that is initially why else in the same the United States, this topic has caused such outrage was caused by the fact that the taxpayers are funding this science. So the taxpayers pay the money and then the government  out of that money gives grants to scientists to do the research. And the grants are big and they do these research and based on the results of this of these studies they write these scientific articles in magazines and then they send them to a scientific publishing house and the scientific publishing house closes it and puts a high price tag on it and that's it. Of course it's no longer the author himself like the citizens of the country can't get access to these scientific or the authors themselves.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Which made on their tax.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yes.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: and this outrageous.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well yes if you look at the profits of these scientific corporations, it's out there.  surpasses Google, BMW and our oil banking industries.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Not bad.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah surpassing the profits of these corporations. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: How is it that you got the idea to take it all down. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, how can I put it? When I was a student myself (🕰20:00) at the university, you know, when I was graduating  and I was studying to be a computer scientist with a degree in security.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Here you go. You are a hacker. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Ihad such a dream when I was a kid and maybe I thought about becoming a hacker or something like that. I know, but it was very fashionable back then and yeah. when I was graduating from university  I didn't know anything about it. and I wanted to do a degree in neuro-computer interface that is that's just the kind of projects that are  the most famous of which is the chip brain Ilona Mask. There is a lot of talk about  it now, but basically it's pretty old theme, I mean in 2003 you can see there's this scientist Theodor Berger, he was developing a hippocampal implant. of the hippocampus. So for the brain, it's kind of like artificial memory or something like that. I do not really know if he ended up didn’t work out, but there was  a lot of writing about it. And at the time when I graduated university, it was like in 2009 they were writing more about neuro-computer interfaces, you know, you put  some kind of a cap on your head and you could sort of you could, like, use your mind to control the mouse cursor on the on the screen.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: So how ?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well of course it's actually all it's quite complicated and it's a lot of work. But for handicapped people it might have use because they don't have any other way, but of course a healthy person it's easier to do it with their hands. The technology is very interesting and yes and at the time and I wanted to to look for something in that direction in my diploma and I had a hypothesis there was that like, to enter the password with my mind. I mean that is to use this fingerprint of the brain as a password and so I started searching the internet for information on this and all the information was in these expensive scientific journals. I even remember at the time that I was very confused, well I basically spent  all the time  at school while I was studying at university I was using different pirate sites to download science books. Therefore, I thought that, like these science journals  I could download somewhere for free, but on the Internet it's like everything's already out there. I looked on torrents somewhere else and there wasn't anything anywhere and  already I thought there must be some kind of program maybe or some kind of website so that you could scientific journals downloaded for free. It was around 2009, well, two years later in 2011 I started communicating on online forums on scientific forums and was a frequent visitor of the molecular biology forum. That forum was Russian-speaking and there were both scientists from Russia and those who had gone abroad.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D:  Soviet kind of people.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yes, Soviet, and  there were a lot of people there people with this kind of problem. They couldn't get access to some magazines and for them there was a a special section which was called full text well by the way it's still there and you can see that a person went in there and put an ad in there, like, can you help me download this kind of article and for example some colleague who's gone abroad he can see it and send it the person here if he himself had access of course. Because even in western universities, not all journals have access especially at these prices, of course they only subscribe only some of them. Every university is only subscribed to a certain part of journals and of course there are individual universities that have very good subscriptions there are a lot of them available but not many of them. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: But maybe there are some kind of mega sponsors who can pay for it.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: I have noticed that for some reason Canadian universities have good subscriptions.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D:  Maybe the Americans help them out like a beggar.  </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah,  Canada is   an interesting country. I mean you don't hear much about it and there is also has the country of Indonesia I mean if you look at it for example  the countries that are most use the Sci-Hub there would be India, China, Brazil, and those are more or less well known and then all of a sudden  I saw on the list that there was Indonesia and I was very surprised because I've never heard anything about it.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I have relatives there and they have good universities there. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: And they're also one of the of the most active users. At least in the news this country doesn't show up much in the news.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I don't remember exactly but about 300 million people live there.  In terms of population, it is gigantic. So where were we,</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: There was a place where people were helping each other and maybe not exactly legal in terms of the law that's a little bit of an issue, too. Although it's still not exactly the same as when you just put some paid scientific articles in the public domain for free so that everyone to download. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I am sorry to interrupt on this one. I think it is a terribly complicated question. I bought a book for example and then my woman read it and then she gave it to her friend and she gave it to  her husband if it's right that they read it for free, well, it's broken. Right. I mean, with the advent of the internet and the ability  to read and it's all about the money, I still have the same idea that  it shouldn't cost that much and then it's all solved instantly. I used to serve in  the police and   they paid 200 rubles per caught murderer and a computer game cost 495,  so it was to catch two  and a half killers in order for me to buy one computer game, well this is nonsense.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: what time was it? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: In the '90s and for example, my salary  was 1,080 rubles, and one DVD with a western movie cost 900 rubles. So how it impossible, how do you even eat here for a month of hard work, . and here you see some stupid piece of plastic costs 900 rubles or something like  this.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, of course it is hard to make a movie, but look at the salaries thhses actors get.  It seems to me they could be cheaper. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: That is why in high school firstly you had to take  singing lessons to sing like Olga Buzova and P.E. classes to bounce like some basketball player, and the the rest is bullshit because these people live better than anyone else, obviously.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: And by the way, those same soccer players there's match broadcasting and stuff like that.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Next thing you know, this cost me 1,000 rubles and this costs 900 rubles some stupid movie of highly dubious artistic merits. So time has passed and  now that broadband internet and everything is good now I go in and there's a huge a lot of movies you can watch for free is one thing. but it looks like they're going to show you a little bit of advertising. Yeah. Either pay for it or, I do not know. starting at from 90 rubles to, like, 200 well, 300 and that's basically it's two cups of coffee, in fact, and so  As a result, it is no longer stealing in in such quantities as they used to steal. They just changed the economic model and It's much easier for people to use two buttons on the phone and watch. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, people it might be easier, but it's led to to the fact that now we have some huge monopoly companies out there. YouTube, which owns the entire of the internet and in fact it seems to me I think there should still be a lot of  small companies. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: But they arbitrarily merge capitalism all the time there is no such thing as monopolization it's not just the united states there's, for example, antitrust legislation.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, it does not work.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Yes, it does. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: It doesn't work with Facebook, it doesn't work with YouTube, it doesn't work with Google.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: They wait for the buildup critical mass and then they start and then start dividing them up.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah, but still  YouTube benefits the very Americans who watch it. There's some kind of centralized system that's watched all over the world. It's politically biased, well, speaking of which give me access to the TV, I'll elect a monkey as president.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Well, I saw it recently. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: You mean Biden.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Well, the thought occurred to me, yes. How to concentrate it all make it a single resource where it all would be. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: So that's how it leads  to capitalism, which is what it's based on. It exists at the expense of property rights  in this case the right of intellectual property rights or just popularly known as copyright that is, if you create some kind of a website that's just going to show there the same movies and you don't have you don't have permission to do that then it's just going to be blocked by Roskomnadzor or whatever other countries have regulators. And then of course there shouldn't be Then of course there won't be a problem. To be honest it's just my opinion that it's necessary in principle to somehow get away from this notion of intellectual property and move to intellectual communism because it is in principle  intellectual property is this (🕰30:00) some kind of self-contradictory notion. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I share this idea strongly, but I have to act as an opponent. So what was the decision? Making a wensite huh?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: yes there was a lot of people who had that kind of problem and  I remember that I worked as a freelancer in the summer.   Well in the summer and in the spring I was taking orders mostly to create some kind of scripts and, you know. little web stories and. that's when it became clear to me how  you could program a website that could automatically use different passwords there and automatically download. That is, a person will just go there and click a button and he download the article for free. But when  I had this idea, I thought would it really work, I mean,  I was just curious to see.  If you run such a thing will it basically work or not and it turned out to really work. I posted on this forum that I was now a service for automatic access to scientific literature and I started all forum users to send out that's the ad and I got it just a thank you in return I mean, people were just dancing for joy. There was practically no one was saying how it's you can't steal, no, but everybody was just very happy and so basically this website immediately became so popular locally and then it just gradually grew, but in principle I knew of course that  abroad there is a movement called - open access that is for open access which is for articles to be free. Well then, I did not go into the details of its history or whatever, I just knew that it existed and in principle to me its ideas seemed right to me and for me it was always something to do with communism, you know, if something is free and for everybody it's communism. There is a site  gradually grew so much and already some of the details of that topic I I started to look into it later, some political details.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: So everything was doing it on their own or who was there with a group of of enthusiasts? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: No, there wasn't a group of enthusiasts. and there wasn't some kind of team  I mean, this is the first version of the script I just sat down at my computer and I wrote it myself and since I was working as a freelancer it was basically for me it was something of a chore. For example you take an order and you make a program and then you publish it and basically just like I did with the website Sci-Hub.  </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: So where do you get the university's passwords to the libraries come from.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: That's how the passwords at the time there were forms where different people posted passwords like this and some of them were selling them, so there was for example one password is $40 there's 200 and some were for sale. I mean different places like that on the internet and basically if you just give somebody a password where you put it in the public domain you put it out there. it doesn't last very long and it will close right away and if it's like standing on the Sci-Hub and the Sci-Hub itself downloads all the user requests, then it is closed and  respectively the password works. There some passwords worked for months and years at first so all users were downloading  and everyone was happy. Then I remember that I had somewhere like well every university he signed up for something different. And so, for example, you need to get access to some article and you don't know which university had a subscription to that journal and you have for example there's ten or a hundred passwords and going through each password and checking and if there's access to that article. it's kind of a hassle and I also needed a program like this. Sci-Hub that can do this more less automatically. So at what</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: So how fast did it start to fill up? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: at first, of course, there wasn't any base. I mean, it was just a subject matter, </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D:  is it wide-ranging from nuclear physics to some kind of archaeology? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yes absolutely everything. I mean, any scientific journal out there. There is no difference in subject matter the humanities there's even philosophy on theology. By the way I'm thinking of doing in the future some kind of a selection of journals on theology from the Sci-Hub. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: And that too for money? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah. In addition, there is many humanities journals access is harder to find.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Are there fewer of them? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: I don't know, maybe there's like less subscriptions or something. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: so it is starting to fill up. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: At what rate? How? Well, at first it was pumping about 40 60 articles an hour, and then it it all grew and it became more like 30 articles per minute. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: A visitors started coming in. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Yeah. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: how did visitation grow?</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well at first  it was somewhere in the early days a few thousand visitors a day and it was mostly people from Russia.  In Russia, I myself promoted the site on forums like this molecular biology forum then and then on the chemistry forum Himport.ru and I put an ad there too and people were happy about it but then I saw that it was placed on forum ru-board and then after a while about the website found it in china, India and Iran. I remember that there was such a huge flow of users that website just collapsed and I then of course I restricted it by IP address so you couldn't  to download something from China. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Therefore, it was on some free service and that's why</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Yes, the first time it was hosted on a free hosting, but then of course I moved it to something more expensive. I remember there for a long time it was on hosting which cost 40 euros  a month and then on some more expensive one. So as it grew and  there was a period of time when  you couldn't download and you couldn't to go to the Sci-Hub from China or Iran.  I also remember that when I turned it off the Iranian IPs from the Sci-Hub website there was a little tech support and there was a a huge bang from users  from Iran. Moreover, it seems that after some time I gave them back</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: I mean, people who do not have any money finally have access to normal scientific literature. So how did the number of visitors grow? For what period how many became. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: What period how many became. Well, basically, you can look it up now here on the computer. So well here's June 2012 for example there's somewhere around 2,000 to 3,000 unique visitors then by  the end of the year jumped to two times 7 thousand visitors well the end of 2012 now look further . So for example from 13 to 15, so we're about September here thirteenth year here up to 30 thousand visitors then it goes up again. and then it drops off again, I guess. when it just spiked, I turned off the foreign pawns. September 2014 here are 10-20 thousand visitors Well the end of the year here again about 30.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: For a scientific resource, that is a lot. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Oh, well, that is still not so much compared to what it's become. So here it is from '15 to '17. it is growing, so if at the beginning of 2015 or so. there were 25,000, 30,000, 40,000 visitors a year later in February 2016 it's 131,000 here is 125 000 well more than a hundred, and by the beginning of 2017 there is a already about 200 thousand visitors was a day </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: It took me 18 years to catch up with 100,000 a day. 18</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: 18? Well, there are now  half a million a day on website.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: That is solid. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Yeah.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: this is as I understand it without investing in advertising to promote it, it's just like a snowball.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A:  Yeah, well, of course the Sci-Hub also has a Facebook group, and I've been tried it for a while to promote it for a while, you know, it's just that you buy an ad and you and your group somewhere in another group and they advertise like that. It's  nothing brought there that is well there will be two or two hundred people after the ad into the group, so I don't think it had no effect at all, especially moreover, he grew up mostly abroad. And this was a Russian-speaking group After that I didn't really invest any money in the promotion I didn't invest any more money.  That is, it was mostly  people found out about the site from their colleagues by word of mouth and the fact that he was still in early 2016 it was written about it in a major media outlet The Atlantic abroad and after that also about the site was written about in very reputable (🕰40:00) scientific journals there Science and Nature. That is I mean, the very fact that the site got there is very cool and it basically reflects the fact that the Sci-Hub has sort of become a scientific revolution like that. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Absolutely. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Yeah. I mean those scientific articles that for a very long time remained at very expensive prices, they're suddenly on the Sci-Hub.  They're all available for free. There's even scientific studies came out that through the Sci-Hub has access to almost all the scientific literature now, of course I know that there's a lot of stuff that's not there, but if we're talking about exactly the popular  and demanded journals they're there. And it was 2016 and then of course after these publications about him more people found out, well, in principle it's always been a bit of a mystery that so much time it  took. That is, the service will appear in 2011 and for a very long time about about it despite the fact that it somehow at once very welcomed in science and despite this for a very long time in all the media,  including scientific ones about him a kind of deafening silence.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Perhaps this is because it is a little illegal.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: I remember that even in 2015.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: And the citizens who use it they are afraid that maybe there's going to be some kind of liability they have with it no problem, if you download movies in Germany from a torrent you're going to get they'll come and then  you'll be fined very quickly. Of course, they will warn you first. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: There have even been some of the funniest cases where when the police knocked on the door of a nine-year-old girl or a grandmother about the fact that they downloaded something from a torrent and there was  girl downloaded some cartoon.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Scumbag.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Therefore, I remember that 2015 I was reading also on  some foreign newspaper about "I can hasp it pdf" tag for twitter. I mean you know what twitter is, right? So someone came up with this tag that a person,  is tweeting that please help me download this article and put this tag "I can hasp it pdf"  and then the other person with that tag can see and help that person send and about this in 2015 in the foreign media wrote about it and I looked at it and thought well it's still a few years ago was done at our molecular biology forum and then the Sci-Hub appeared and no one does that anymore. But there's some kind of alternative reality. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: I mean, here they are position themselves as mega free countries and there for some reason there's nothing free circulating but the horrible totalitarian Russia for some reason everything circulates there. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: yes. It is by the principle of legends, the same library geniuses is  the largest portal also with scientific literature but specializing in books it's also kind of from Russia. Before library geniuses, there was this huge pirate library there there was about half a million books, I think it was called Gigipedia or or library in new and as I remember it the creators were in Ireland but after a lawsuit, it seems that in 2012 it was shut down. So that's it and there was a very kind of outrage there, people were outraged all over the place. It always seemed to me that how is that possible, I mean we have some kind of law that forbids, as it were people from freely reading scientific science literature. I guess that says that there's some kind of law that's wrong. But why don't we see this somehow discussed in the state the Duma both at home and abroad Why is it that this topic is somehow is hushed up. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: looking at our Duma I always  feel  a severe moral suffering Why are there singers? Why are there athletes if it is a legislative body? Maybe lawyers should be elected there lawmakers, so to speak, who have special legal education or do you think that if there is a turner Vasya from or the singer Lyusya from the stage  they'll somehow make the right laws. You do not understand what this is.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: So you see, that is how it turns out. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: So here, they do not understand, I am sure they do not understand, on all levels and they don't understand it like the fight against telegram. When they started shutting down telegram, they were hitting the bank sites that are running on amazon servers. So why don't you understand how this works.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well by the way if we are talking about fighting of Telegram there was  some effect there. As I remember in the State Duma they introduced a bill to block Telegram. I think there is a guy like Pasha Durov, whether you like him or not he's a mega-talent who has built something and can benefit the Russian state. Why has your Pasha Durov gone abroad? And is doing something there, why don't you keep him here, don't give him money here you don't give him a platform to expand, so to speak to his fullest potential. He is over there in America is trying this electronic money like this crypto currency. In addition, why does not he do our crypto currency in Russia? So put it in the Sayano-Shushenskaya hydroelectric power plant there's some of those mining farms mine our cryptocurrency there our cryptocurrency, we'll cover the whole globe, strangle everybody and instead of that let's ban Telegram.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: I think it's just that Durov himself didn't wanted to because his political liberal views.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: He is the one who works for the money I mean here's the money Pasha come here and work here. All talent should be lured back, not as they are sitting over there in Germany, Israel and America and working for the Pentagon inventing weapons to kill in our country. What is for? Bring everybody back.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: It's considered that abroad there's freedom and we're kind of a dictatorship. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: That is what they say. You know I used to go to this wonderful country France where there are cows running around. Norman cows in Normandy like the the cover of Pink Floyd’s band  there's "atom heart mother" there was a record like that. there's a nice cow on it. I wanted to take a picture of the cow I tell my friend to take a picture of it. and he says you can't. Why not? You cannot stop here, it's the countryside.  And that's why you can't let anyone drive by. and we'll get a fine. Therefore, we have been driving for two weeks and found two places where You can stop to take pictures of a cow, but  the rest are prohibited, you can't go to the forest you cannot make bonfires in the lakes, no fishing, no hunting You cannot do anything. How is it that you living here? You know, ours is the most ferocious Stalinism's fiercest bastards compared to them. In terms of freedoms you couldn't even dream of freedoms we have, go wherever you want, do whatever you want. You can swim, pick mushrooms and fish and no one will say a word to you. We are distracted.  We have freedom, yes. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, if you are talking specifically about the telegram, it is still telegram was promoted in the media and there even, for example, if we're talking about Russian Today there was always something written about it.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: And how not to write, if we all We all sit there, have accounts, for example, have 69,000 subscribers on my channel. That's It's not enough, apparently.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Now it's like that for everyone. I mean, there used to be some maybe maybe millionaire channels at the dawn of there of the internet and at the dawn of the telegram as well and and now there are so many of them that they all have 20,000 to 100,000 subscribers and the same number of views.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: It is still a lot. I will come in from the other side here. there used to be magazines not so long ago paper magazines, you know, 300,000 and that was a serious circulation, and I have two of these, for example, and on YouTube I have two a million subscribers no magazine could ever have that many subscribers. Well, you have to use it somehow, no.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well Sci-Hub on the contrary, as opposed to Telegram or, for example, the likes of heroes of freedom of information like foreign Such as Snowden or Assange like telegram, for example popular resources well how many people use the same Snowden works directly no well his example too  very strongly and powerfully promoted but and about the Sci-Hub on the contrary there is some such silence and that's in spite of the fact that in principle  it's not just used by scientists,  I even know that it is used in Kurchatov Institute and for example doctors. I mean most of these of scientific journals are medical journals and doctors need this information in order to, you know, understand how best to diagnose how best to treat patients.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: it ids the most important aspect. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: yeah, so I've even had this review about that this is a site that saves people's lives, literally. Here, I mean the important problem and even here's when in 2018 Roskomnadzor decided to ban the Sci-Huub and there was an outcry about it from Russian doctors and even then there was complete silence in the media as if as if this problem did not exist at all</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: So they're probably just not interested, though. I see skills in PR so called very little it is necessary to PR in a different way, for example, you have to grab a doctor who's doing for example a doctor who is doing scientific research here Volodya, let's sit down and tell us what you do (🕰50:00) What kind of literature do you read? Do you know English is what was said in the beginning that it is today is the language of science. You don't happen to read the notes, do you? Huh? where? really on the Sci-Hub and what benefit did you get from it what did you you read and what concrete benefit to you. If that's what you're doing. if you do that, then yes, there will be a stir. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: So I was expecting that the media themselves would do it. the media themselves, I mean, they'd call in some doctors, some scientists. when the principle became known. I think it's a good thing. that's what the media should be doing to do that, that is to look for some people to raise Publicly important cases and so on.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: If you do not do it yourself, no one will do it at all. They will do the crap.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: If we're talking about that Snowden and Assange  they were helped. but the Sci-Hub is the other way around.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: This is a matter of state security but what's not clear to me personally is that it's like at the dawn of our so to speak piracy in the 90's you could go for thirty rubles to buy a DVD which has windows Photoshop 3d max and so on and so forth. When I went to the official offices to work where you want you don't want, you have to have everything officially and all of a sudden it turns out that some 3d max is where the three-dimensional models</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah, I remember that program.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: It costs almost $4,000, and the office you need, like, three modelers sitting there. and you'd need three or twelve of them, and in those days.  an apartment cost that much. In fact, Photoshop cost 800 bucks if I remember correctly but then again Here is the broadband internet Here is this Photoshop I do not know what of this Adobe you have got to get Premier or something. That is 30 bucks a month that is 35. However, you do not  need everything, right? Not the whole package. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah, you can do it on a subscription, too. It's perfectly fine, but somehow it's...</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: it's not for  $4,000 at a time. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: This has led to these monopolies. Huge monopolies that we have like apple and so on.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Therefore, my point is why then the masses of people could use it, develop it somehow. well okay if it's enemy articles that are paid for and our scientific don't write which are free of charge by the way and that's how it is.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: well by the way we also have  one in Russian pay journals, but it's still humanly possible to write an article for 100 rubles. Sometimes there are articles for 200 I mean, there may be some de-aspirants possible</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: That is, if it is a hub which so say, in all directions leads here there is a part free and part paid. Well, for 100 rubles, I do not know in my opinion who anyone for 100 rubles can buy the necessary professional note to read. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: The website Sci-Hub is about collecting donations and there people themselves send 100 rubles or even more just to keep the work of the site and by the way I remember it now donates no one can be surprised I mean, nowadays anyone collects donations YouTube, and even children, and then it was 2013 year and that's when the Sci-Hub started collecting donates directly from their site and for a few thousand dollars maybe for a few days. I mean, it was so cool. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I remember the first time I recorded a greeting for the first time. And they gave me a thousand dollars for an hour and I realized that I was doing something wrong. I was doing something wrong.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Was it on YouTube? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: No, it was a long time ago. Probably seven or eight years ago. It is a completely different area of funding is completely different. but nobody's surprised by donations these days. Well you cannot, but the entire enemy's books don't intelligently tell you that if you're you're out there doing some I don't know play the guitar, carve matryoshka dolls. whatever if you can find a thousand people who will give you ready to create looking at your so-called so called creativity or whatever it is you you're doing they're willing to give you ten bucks a a month. That's not much, how much is 600 rubles 500. Yes, that's if a thousand people, then all your problems in life are solved. you're doing, and that's all you'll be able to do. You'll be able to live comfortably and these people sponsor you, so to speak. your activities for their own enjoyment and pleasure and all that. Why not?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: of course that's why in principle paid content you don't need it</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: well maybe it's like a university I can buy something myself, put it and you use no? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well buying and and put it out in the public domain, . also a violation yes .</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: But so if it's our if it's there are so many visitors and such how many there are half a million visitors to the site well probably science must be something it is interesting that here is such a resource, no?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: I actually have many reviews. I mean, I recently published a page from my email in 2020 website and after that I received several thousand e-mails from all over the world there. From Europe, from the UK, from Switzerland, the United States, and of course China from Iran and a lot of them from Latin America there is Brazil, Mexico from Africa. They are also using the Sci-Hub there.  and all have written a huge thanks for this resource I have a few thousand e-mails are stored  and I'm thinking of asking more users more about their work and maybe write some of those stories of using the resource on the site to write well really the Sci-Hub it's become quite such a big event in general in the world science.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: without any exaggeration. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: it seems to me that at that time Russia could somehow make such a political step that is to legalize in basically legalize the work of this resource well as it for example a lot of Russian scientists use it and it would be it seems to me that it would be a very big deal even if we're talking about some kind of competition with the United states it would be a very big ideological blow to the Western I mean, how come all of a sudden?</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: What happened instead? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: well instead it turns out that for some reason was basically silenced somehow. the discussion of this project in the media.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Well, how can it be silenced if you do not? If you do not speak, no one will pay attention to you. Excuse my immodesty I can  I can give you an example of myself, if I translate a movie I sometimes translate movies. at least ten times as many people watch it usually even more. If you think that there is a giant line of employers with shouting Dmitry Yurichev translate please translate us a movie nothing of the sort. You have to run through about ten concrete walls with your head, make an inhuman effort to make friends with everyone,  and then maybe, I mean. maybe you'll become someone's interesting. If you don't have that direct human interaction when you're with these specific people that you depend on all sorts of things you communicate with them and you show them something, you're doing them some benefit to them, which is quite obvious to them. To begin with, you explain to them what you're doing a serious benefit, then yes, maybe. But for someone to come and interested in you and start to promote, which is exactly the promotion no media mentions and stuff like that doesn't happen.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Why not? After the The website hub was written about in the media after that, I got a lot of letters from various western journalists who were interested in the topic and what this project is all about. I mean, the the project basically became known to a wider audience and because it's a pretty important topic regularly talks about some kind of new discoveries of science, even the most trivial ones.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Sorry to interrupt.  I can see two things at once there are people who take advantage of this are Westerners especially the Americans and the British and the French and others. They clearly understand that they're doing something wrong and they're they're breaking the law and that's why they won't they won't talk about it. They will not talk about it at all. They will use it and they will not talk about it. and then when it gets to us for sure there are some I do not know but I am pretty sure there are some interstate agreements signed there. and stuff like that where this has to be to stop on the territory of the Russian federation and Roskomnadzor according to in accordance with that, it stops it like that. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: If we're talking about the users themselves,  in principle, the project has a lot of feedback in addition to  personal reviews in the letters that is, if you go to the same twitter and and write the Sci-Hub you can see how many  scientists use the Sci-Hub and praise it. The Sci-Hub also has groups in social networks for example, VKontakte where there are also  reviews are already from Russian scientists and even about the smallest scientific discoveries all the same publishes. And here you get such a big event that the top scientific journals there's like actually a revolution in science and quite important topics if we're talking specifically about access to medical information (🕰60:00) and for some reason it's somehow been that's been neglected in a very strange way.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Again, sorry to interrupt, I would just insist that there's more to this the apostle Jesus Christ said if I remember correctly go to the doctor and cure because the cured believe the doctor. Unequivocally he would immediately accept Christianity and start preaching the same the same thing here should have been or now is. for example, focus on doctors and this so to speak, the mainstream that we're not here to play around, we're here to save people's lives. Bring a doctor and let us sit down and talk, Here is a doctor. How do you use it? How do you use it? and how it's helped you and how it's helped you save lives. and then it should all come from the medicine to spread the width of it if you don't do it that nobody does anything.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: I mean, I have even,  taken testimonials from some doctors and just recently sent them out there to various journalists and I think even in the new newspaper there a sign from a friend of mine said that a lot of newspapers could publish it, but they won't because I am a Stalinist. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: It is important here totalitarianism</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: yes and so at first the journalist interested and then answered that the the editorial board turned the topic down and so on it happened with some media outlets, so it's like first the journalist is interested and then they say that the editorial board refused to print the story and it was the same  with Rasha today. I mean, I was told that the story was turned down at the top.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Maybe they were joking. Do not particularly believe people. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Maybe.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: The other side of the whole There is YouTube, for example. There’s people who are interested in it there's the scientific community they all have social networking almost everybody has it. if you make your own video to appeal to people insofar as they're firmly aware that they're all about a lot of, so to speak, professional achievements, for example, they owe personally you are the one who built the resource that they use and benefit from. benefit from it and now help me shout a little louder. No, I mean help. It is not at all certain that it has  the same result as a broadcast on on channel one of Russian television. But it does have the effect that you can do personally</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah  of course I don't sit like that I'm promoting this project on social media and by the way here in twitter that you've seen there individual tweets from the Sci-Hub  they're getting like a million hits.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: my respect, yes. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: And then quite recently. there was a lawsuit situation against the website in in India, I mean on or about December 21st I received from the Indian court saying that we were being sued in India and that and they're demanding that we block absolutely all the addresses of the Sci-Hub, I mean, like. if Roskomnadzor blocks some address then you can put another address and and in India there the publishers demanded a dynamic blocking that is to say that absolutely any new address is blocked So I posted this bad news on Twitter just to share that soon to be banned in India and  I didn't expect the effect it had. I mean there was a real explosion there.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: A packet of yeast fell in India.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: It's just that a lot of, like. of Indian scientists there started to get outraged. writing articles  In the media on twitter too, that if you shut down the Sci-Hub. How are we ever going to do science, it's like we don't have paid access and we don't have that much money and there's some scientific communities in India have sent a request to the court that  the Sci-Hub not to be blocked. So after that, I was contacted by lawyers who offered to defend the the Sci-Hub in an Indian court and that's all this happened after one little Tweet and sometime later  I think it was January 6. well, after all of these events, the tweet of  Sci-Hub was blocked.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Strange that it lasted so long.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: It's kind of been around since 2012 it seems like a lot of years and without any problems. I do remember there was one situation when the account was frozen and required to upload a passport scan well what is there really me some a real person but after  I did it and there were no problems And now, all of a sudden, he was banned and tweeted. no explanation as to why explanation why The website hub was blocked well that is technically of course the reason there's some kind of content there which supposedly violates how the for several years it was and what exactly happened it's just now that there's twitter noticed all of a sudden decided to block it. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: maybe a letter went out to law enforcement authorities.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A:  Yes exactly which one, that is, they did not give about that explanation.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: two months ago. my Facebook account got shut down and disappeared. They sent me a type of send an ID. I took a picture of my driver's license and sent a reply. I got a sign saying sorry, we have a Covids epidemic here. we can not quickly and here they are for the third month already looking. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: And you too bloced?</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Yeah, without any explanation. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A:  I read that for example, Russian media pages blocked there, they blocked satellite, but then they apologized and unblocked it. But no one is going to apologize to the Sci-Hub.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: It's not helpful if they're banning Trump legally elected president is being banned, it's nonsense to talk about some commoner out there. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: This is exactly when it happened about January 6th and after that there was an article on a torrent frig but there's a site that covers all sorts of piracy news and yeah about the twitter banned and there people started in the outrage in the comments. Oh, that is kind of useful resource got banned and it's Tramp who's on there all sorts of tweets like that.  and soon after that they banned Tramp. Maybe they somehow listened to people's opinions.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: They put Donald in.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: but I know the principle there it was not just tramp that got banned a bunch of people. in that timeframe.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: at this point in time, what's the status state the project is in. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: well at the moment it's in a state of stability, I mean. I mean it's reached about 500,000 users a day or so. the number fluctuates and that's it. little by little.   By the way, it was recently banned in in the UK literally maybe a month ago.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: To protect the British scientists from this outrage after all. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: yeah and it's kind of like they've even had the police issue some kind of a warning not to students to use this site and there's a lot of British scientists laughed about it on Twitter, you know I mean, it is kind of like access to science suddenly banned by the government. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: it is not an easy situation. So we have everything works, people come in and use it</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: yeah it is like in 2018 he was banned by Roskomnadzor, the site  continues to be available just at another address So that's the situation so far, but I in principle I want to the site completely legalized that is that is to say that it's legal to read scientific literature even for free is legal.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I'm afraid that this is in conflict with the laws of of other states who think it's worth money if it's in any magazines. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: right that is why it can only be done by  an independent state and what kind of independent state there is on the planet right now? Russia.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I would start again with medicine. I'm talking about how lives are being saved people and how it benefits the scientific community, one, to society as a whole, two. medicine is progressing because of the fact that scientists are able to freely to share knowledge and discoveries and other techniques on how to treat here how to treat there.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: It's all on your own, after all.  it's still hard and it requires not only time but also financial resources And if it were done by a media outlet, of course. of course it would be much easier. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: No one is going to do it,  they will not do anything. The drowning men are the drowning men's business  no god or tsar can save us  or a hero on our own  there's no other way I would recommend starting with medicine. is the right one, that's it bashing through the wall with your head and then, well. friends, the very last one will be nuclear physics where atomic bombs are made but that's understandably strategic the state security areas and so on. But  here friends, let's work together to save children in Africa, for example to cure them we do not have to, because you are paying 30 Note that is a great idea with medicine should be started to do There's no other way to do it on your own. Alexandra, but you see how many years and no one's moved. How is it going on your own?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: What? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Overall. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: I am now [sounds] recently, if you put it that way formally in 2019 finished my master's degree St. Petersburg State University and just in time for the Covid entered graduate school at the Institute of the (🕰70:00) Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Seriously? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yes, I had basically, I had this idea to, like scientifically prove within the framework of the philosophy of science that science, in principle, is inherently should be open and only an open of science it functions successfully. Well some such an idea</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: and how long do you have to study?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Now I am finishing first year and so we have a post-graduate school now three years.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Really? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yeah. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Alexandra not only know how to build websites. What can I to say in conclusion draw a line well do not want to do it yourself in any way otherwise. I can provide practical help with the publication of videos, with some specialists come by themselves and do you have Russian citizenship?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: I have Kazakh citizenship. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: How interesting Soviet man. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yes, the Soviet Union you can count. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: And to move here no plans</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Well, I've been living  in Russia since 2011. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Living and being a citizen are different. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: yes I came in 2011 and  I did not go anywhere else, that is, if you do not take into account that there for a couple of days I went home to Kazakhstan and then I went  back, and then in 2012 there was a short trip to France with my mom and after that all that time I kind of studied at different master's programs and in 2015 I tried to apply for Russian citizenship as a native of the Russian language that is, in my opinion, at that time this law was introduced only it was introduced that if a person has relatives there who were born on the territory of the Russian Federation that is, ancestors or rather  grandparents and a person is a native speaker of the Russian language, that is, the Russian language Native then he can apply for citizenship and get citizenship there in a simplified and I wanted to  to take advantage of that opportunity. I also filed the documents and I rather got birth certificate, birth certificates, you know,  my grandmother she was born I think in the village of Zaozerne near Krasnoyarsk and my mother was born in Krasnoyarsk and then my older my mom's sister, she went back in the soviet government at the aviation institute in Riga and after graduation she was she was transferred to Kazakhstan and after that the whole family also moved to Kazakhstan you're basically in Almaty there much warmer fruits and vegetables are quite interesting. But of course after the collapse of the Soviet Union. we all stayed in Kazakhstan. So I applied and I went to take the Russian language exam.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Is that necessary </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Yes, to prove  that you're a native speaker. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: But speaking is not enough and you have to take the exam?  What are the subjects and the predicate or what?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: Anyway, the exam was, like I think we were shown some kind of film about the Crimea and the sound was really bad I mean, in my my family kind of spoke only Russian everything and there was no other language and there was this sound that basically it was even hard to perceive this the movie something about Crimea and then you had to fill in the answers to the questions about Crimea. And the questions on the movie are kind of what I remember there was talk about such a place as darkness of the cockroach. It turns out that it is in fact it It's spelled “tmu tarakan” Well I think in Russian colloquially it's all called darkness. It is something like that and after you fill out this test after then you sit down for, like, a job interview they ask you why you have Russian citizenship. I had a woman ask me that she seemed unfriendly.  Why do you need citizenship? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Really</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: But saying well with Citizenship it is somehow more convenient to live I live in Russia anyway why do I really need citizenship  if you think about it and well just citizenship gives a person a person more rights and if now I need any reason to stay in Russia that is I have to either study or work somewhere then after I get the passport you can just live. That is  I was confused then, too, and I just I couldn't find an answer and then after that exams and interviews I get a paper that it turns out Russian is not my native language.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: That is what the experts determined, yes. Moreover, you can come at it from the other side I have Jewish friends in the 90's who want to to the Netherlands and migrate from russia what do? Well, the best way to go anti-semitism ran to the garages on one garage painted a huge Swastika my friend Dima stood near Swastika he was photographed with this this photo, I can't live in such a place. Dutch citizenship immediately put. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: As a political asylum yes?</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: yes, maybe you should do the same. Perfect. I'm kind of lost, even for me personally of course not as expert as  the migration service but I do not hear in your speech that you  lived in Kazakhstan I do not hear the typical Central Asian stuff I do not hear.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: But there is a specific Central Asian accent.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: well, I do not hear but still, even if it is there  so what in general the interview, it's not about  watching your idiotic movies with audio interference and answering some stupid questions. Oh, man. That is a good one. Yeah, but will you find out motherland. That is great</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: And then there was also it said that I was supposedly making some mistakes but that can't be true. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: So upper division education and everything and everything that comes with a master's degree doesn't count, right?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: But at the time, I hadn't finished a master's degree.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: Does not matter if you have a degree it doesn't, does it? Here's the the guys who do the foundations in the wheelbarrows carry earth, they're good for Russian citizenship and highly educated specialists don't, interesting. It seems to me that it's like the united states that's how sucking in a vortex of people from all over the world and we'll choose who to let in a good education, a degree, some jobs come on in and you all  goodbye. Great The mother country welcomes you.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>A: They say to me maybe they looked on the Internet what you're doing and decided not to give you citizenship.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>D: I'm afraid no one there that deep, I'm afraid. At the time. I was kind of offended at the time, you know it's like you've been speaking Russian since from birth and then all of a sudden they tell you no Russian is not your native language.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Great.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: You are making some mistakes in your writing. It is can't possibly be true because I know that  I always write everything correctly and then you made me look grammatically illiterate and the main thing I wrote a story about it in my blog and after that look at Wikipedia appeared about me such a line that here I am well, like such a fool could not could not pass the Russian language exam. You can interpret it that way. That is how it was twisted. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: You cannot give up.  Then, of course, you can try again.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: And in the meantime, they signed the law that you have to take an oath of allegiance citizenship you have to take an oath and in particular there seems to be a line in the oath line that you will comply the law, I thought how come I'm in charge of the Sci-Hub and I don't really care if this project is legal or not. I think it is the right one. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: There's no I'm not going to give you any advice. How did the girl get the idea to do programming? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well, it is really quite simple my mother worked as a programmer I mean, she is the same as her  older sister she studied for a while at Riga University in the specialty I think it was then called system engineer and they worked with these big electronic computers machines whose programs were written on punched cards and then when personal computers started to appear she worked as an accountant for a while and then I switched to programming for 1S accounting like that. Therefore,  I remember from childhood when I was about six a computer at home but I really at first at first I just played with it somewhere else maybe about six years later I remember that my mom would take me to work and there was the internet and I was looking on the internet instructions on how to create my own website and tried something. I remember back then created a little website that was dedicated to different electronic animals. I mean there was this popular tamagotchi thing, you know (🕰80:00) electronic toy you have living inside of you some kind of an animal that you had to feed it and raise it and so on and so on. besides tamagotchi there were programs like that for the computer, so you start it up and your computer starts to live a cat for example walks around the screen there eats it too you can pet it in its sleep and play club and so on and so on and so on there were robot dogs like that at the time that were called ab and they were produced a company called Sony I mean a real robotic dog and I think it even had some neural networks inside it and so I was I thought that I was trying to program a Tamagoshi like that with artificial intelligence, you know, so that he could just eat but also talk and think and so on and so on and so on I basically then I got interested in  neural networks and neurobiology but all sorts of things like that.  I had a period of fascination with hacking, I mean there was a magazine that was also popular at the time when maybe I was about 14 years old.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: I was an outstanding author there.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: By the way. There were all sorts of hacking notes and how to hack. I I remember what I did with the help of of reading an article like that in hacker magazine. to hack into my Internet service provider.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: You're a dangerous man, Alexandra.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: I was talking about that technology at the time I do not know anything at all at that time. a few years later we went through them  at the university for a very long and painful time but at that time I already knew all this stuff. I knew all that stuff. Moreover, after that, I went to entered the university Kazakh National Technical University. I remember that many of the guys there from my I remember a lot of the guys in my class, they went to Russian universities, and I didn't really I didn't really understand why I had to go somewhere. I just went to my own university. I continued studying there as well. I chose and for hacking specialization information safety well and  So I graduated from university after that. I remember that for a while  I applied for a PhD program in neuroscience somewhere in the US in order to develop  my childhood hobby, you know. neurointerface, neurochips and stuff like that. But it didn't work out at the time and then I for a while I was taking orders on the internet to develop different software I worked as a freelancer and that is how and it turned out to be in programming. I still remember that when I was at the university I think I was almost the best programmer in the group. was also in school I mean I somehow from childhood got used to the fact that I'm such a computer genius you know, the kind of person who understands about computers.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: So what was the fruit of all this training?</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: I think the most notable fruit was the creation of the Sci-Hub</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: It's a heavy fruit, you can't argue with that. when you came here, how did it all start? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: I remember that just working  I didn't want to be a programmer,  I mean, I wanted something like that. Well, as far as the Sci-Hub thing,  of course I like it because  it's such a, you know, a job. that you're doing something to liberate of scientific knowledge and so on. Nevertheless, just like programming any kind of random tasks I've always been not very interesting to me and for example in the accounting department that my mother worked in was something I thought was the most unpleasant thing that I thought you could do.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: It's kind of boring. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Economics and, yeah, that kind of thing.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: how does freelancing in general work out all the time or did you try to get a job somewhere? trying to get a job? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Yeah, I remember when I came to 2011 in Russia, I was still working as a freelancer, I mean, I took orders and I did them and so  I got a few tens of thousands rubles a month that's how it was and then I already  decided something well, to go somewhere longer and I applied the documents to the faculty of state management of the Higher School of Economics it it was 2012. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: And? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well, at that time there was this theme all over the place about the use of information technologies in the state about the Internet the modernization of Skolkovo, that's all that that's all Medvedev was promoting. I thought wow.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: He was pushing the right things, by the way.  State services and stuff like that, thanks to him. they say it is a great thing</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Yeah, so what was cool about it that you get that kind of information technology at some global level and I had this idea back then the idea that I could somehow change the system from the inside I mean if now for example we're not allowed by law to freely the free flow of information on the internet if, for example, the law forbids the free exchange of information on the internet. the states in that direction to tweak it, I mean something to fix something and yes, I've applied there I got there and it turned out to be the opposite that is, you apply to the department of public administration and expect that that everything there will basically be so patriotic state, and then for some reason it was the opposite. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: what do you mean, there can't be a state.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well, what about the faculty of government and  I'd expect it to be all about patriotism</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: It's like that Vysotsky song where the devil cursed and said there's the wrong comrade rules the ball. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: it turns out that the teacher had some liberal rhetoric and they kind of disliked me a lot right off the bat. that is, they started picking on me, underestimating grades and so on.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Is it because of political views, right? Yeah. It is dangerous to talk to with faculty members on political issues Do you need that in your life, too? They are not certainly can't reeducate them, but they can screw with  you, they can.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: But I remember back then the situation I had a situation that my teacher  gave me zero points and I could have not be allowed to take the exam something like that was, and I remember that as a result of conflict I ended up getting access to the email account of that teacher's email account but  I didn't hack into it, but  I was able to access it and I saw that the teacher writes about me that I'm such a vile scum and that I should be killed. and the best part is that I'm crazy. Something like that was written. It was a shock for me at all it was a shock to read it, I mean, I  actually I was expecting that it's professor and that there would be some such serious  high topics and it turns out that they're discussing that I'm bastard</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Well, first of all he's a human being and everything else secondary Moreover, how did it end? Did it end or not? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well, I printed out this correspondence and gave it to the assistant provost. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Great. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well, I ended up taking the course passed and I even got an "A" on my exam. But I didn't want to graduate master's program, I still didn't do it. and I only finished one course  and then I started looking for a job as a programmer, I just kind of realized it became clear to me that, first of all, this education won't be much use I mean I'm not going anywhere after I've finished this master's degree I won't  be made minister or president so that I could change something first of all, but secondly, for what scientific reasons I'm still interested in somehow the history of ancient societies that is how once upon a time people understood that that kind of information. And I realized that such studies of him here at the faculty of  public government most likely all the same I will not give me to defend myself, that is, to get a diploma, that's why and after the first year I started looking to look for a job as a programmer.  That was the situation and I remember that I was trying  to get a job at Russia Today. I mean, I did not like it then.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Programmer?</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Yeah, well I liked it at the time basically such a patriotic company. It's all about Russia and stuff like that and I even had an interview and the programmer who was there he had this idea for me to develop software just for video I just think that then  it happened that for some reason I was offered me a very small salary. I think it was 30,000 rubles, but on that kind of money in Moscow to live very it is hard to live like that. It did not work out and I just I think that here is a job which is on video processing program it could, in principle, in the long run there in a few years it could grow into some (🕰90:00) maybe a Russian version of YouTube quite</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: It is not easy.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Why? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: I do not know well  first of all money to you secondly you cannot solve this alone this you need to create a team for this  it's hard. There is Rutube, we do not have the dumbest programmers can see but for some reason, we can't build a YouTube counterpart They have not been able to build a YouTube analog for years.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well, we have one Rutube and there need to be more Let it blossom 100 Flowers and so on</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: how will they make money? It is clear what they make money from. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: We've recently had information published that the same Rasha today journalists get paid half a million rubles each half a million rubles and I think you can imagine how much social networking could be created with this money.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Maybe they are good if half a million rubles. </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: well and the programmers offer 30,000 life is not fair.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: I'll give you the most famous wisdom he invented the ruble built 10 sold 100 is the most important in a capitalist society it is always the one who sells, not the one the one who invents and not the one who makes like this</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well, the leaders of Rasha today are always resenting why we don't have we don't have our own social media why do we  have some foreign social networks which  block Russian channels and  by the way it's about YouTube and the the history of its emergence it sort of first it grew, I think, as part of PayPal and only then did it split off and become an independent social network.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: We have a social networking site, which was built by by the same Pasha Durov.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Yeah and it's kind of like the main social network is YouTube</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Well if we have the USA, we have this projection of heaven on earth if everything is so beautifully done and beautified there if we're part of the family of civilized where there's a division of labor it's normal in capitalism. here's a great YouTube we're going to  use it and then it turns out that they won't let you use it and you so that's being a statesman you didn't think that one day you're going to get the breaker pulled and leave you without it. You did not think so, did you? That is how you design the life of the country inside it might as well be like saying that American submarines are protecting us to protect us, they keep the world at peace for Why the hell would you build your own if the Americans have such wonderful  boats with nuclear weapons. Why do you need your own? and here why do you need this YouTube if it's there Then some time goes by and all of a sudden here it is in big letters all of a sudden it turns out that your idiot TV no one else watches it especially the young people who, so to speak  the future leaders of the country owners and all that stuff and all of a sudden it turns out that they're educated by American YouTube even at the dumbest level just recently  you go into a bookstore there wasn't even a comic book section and now you go into a bookstore and there's shelves and separate and all the comics are for some reason American, you know, they are American and a little bit of Japanese, that's all. And yours where one would like to ask.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: I remember when I was a kid, there was a comic strip called Murzilka. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: I have a question about your children, I mean. your children are being raised by strangers with completely foreign ideals that you nothing and nothing at all and here you have YouTube is the same thing. It is TV. The internet is just a way of delivering information but it's the same TV why so it turns out that you're here you give money to, for example, the TV, the RTR is fine all the grandmas are there for New Year's Alla Borisovna Sofia Rotaru, who with  one hand gives money to kill Russians and then on Russian TV performs beautifully. it is wonderful simply Well, no one is watching this, no one what Your ratings are so high I lose my mind. Money being poured into it and  they start screaming that YouTube is all against us and they're already screaming on our side that it needs to be shut down. The Americans do not have time to pull the switch it's already our weapon. It needs to be shut down. It's a a threat to national security and Where is yours? </span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Our social networks they could be grown within the the company within the framework of the same RT if some money was just would go to  well I honestly don't know I have no idea what you could spend half a million rubles a month. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: You  just don't have it. That is why you have no idea. For example, you could buy yourself a Rolls-Royce, for example that's going to eat up all your money just everything Build yourself a house and hire a house cleaner and that too will eat it all up and it won't be enough all the time  because the main goal of capitalism is to continually increase your level of for example to go to an expensive restaurant or and to everyone to show that I go to an expensive restaurant expensive holiday not somewhere in the Crimea Maldives only this status is the level and other stuff. Half a million is easy to spend believe me.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: If you part of the money if you put it there as a programmer at least like this I would have gotten the job.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: I agree.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Could be social networking.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: I will act as HR here Alexandra is a talented programmer by the way. built I don't even know what to call it the right way to build Sci-Hub on that gets 500,000 hits contact me daily, I'm open to a suggestion, and in passing the show mentions about communism and communist What is your point, are you a communist?</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: well I have always considered myself a communist. But I'm not a professional communist I mean, if, for example.  for example, if I were to go into a debate of course with some politician on political about who I don't know of course I would lose any debate. the idea of communism I've always supported I've always thought that the Sci-Hub as a communist project because first of all it's a project which is for that knowledge belongs to the people so that it's available to everyone and not  just some elite. It's basically a project that is against the very concept of of this intellectual property that is scientific knowledge it should not be as if it were the intellectual property of some corporations but it it should belong to the people. I opened a Sci- Hub group on a social networking site I naturally started to post there different posts on the theme of communism on the theme of science.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Well that is practically putting a stigma on yourself because we're free and entitled to all points of view any political views you can't go anywhere going to go in with communist views.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Why is that? </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Well our state is built on a denial of everything communist.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Therefore, I wondered if that is the problem that maybe that's why the Sci-Hub is under such a censorship regime.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: I do not know from my point of view. first of all, there's nowhere to go as one not the silliest person said the soviet union is our ancient roman it's the basis on which everything is built and there's nowhere to go you can't get away from it. The only thing that still binds us together idea is the victory of the great patriotic war won by communists  over Nazis You cannot get away from that, but you have to build one's own and it's very strange to get hung up on from my point of view is very strange. I would understand if I were, for example, the editor of a state-funded television channel with the money that shows some Zuleikha opens her eyes and all of a sudden you with communist views to be called to broadcast to hundreds of millions of people it would be strange from the point of view of from a propaganda point of view  as a specialist what does that have to do with anything if I can do this and you don't know how to do it then maybe let me do something this is a very strange approach of capitalists It should not be like that.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Well, I had some thought that maybe they were afraid of of Communism</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: as one aspect of maybe but that's about as close as I can see to Russian you don't speak your native language. That is great.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: There is something strange going on. </span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: Do not get hung up on it. My advice to you is to do it all yourself No one is going to give us that You have to do everything yourself. no one's going to come up with anything nothing will come and no one will offer anything it's it's not a fairy tale about a master and a margarita themselves come and offer everything not come and offer only yourself. Nevertheless cool Alexandra my respect what a  to build and to make it so crazy come and see us again we will help you in any way we can Thank you.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>A: Thank you.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>D: That is all for today.</span></div><p class="scrollViewSource">

 hey. I just added Dialogues to Scrolldown.
 cool. But what's Scrolldown?
 Scrolldown is a new alternative to Markdown that is easier to extend.
 how is it easier to extend?
 because it's a tree language and tree languages are highly composable. for example, adding dialogues was a simple append of 11 lines of grammar code and 16 lines of CSS.
 okay, how do I use this new feature?

I am not positive that if we abolished copyright and patent systems the world would be a better place. Just as I'm not positive that if we switch to clean energy the world would be a better place. Society is a big complex system, and it would be intellectually dishonest to make such a guarantee. But there are reasons to believe abolishing copyright and patent systems would be a good bet based on low level first principles. In my study of the spread of truth and knowledge it seems like more publishers and remixers leads to improved truthflow, education, stability and prosperity. Other people might come with other arguments and perspectives. But big debate is not being had. The problem is the debate is always held on the Intellectual Monopoly Industry's home turf. So when the debate is on details like what is the ideal length of monopolies, or when illogical terms like "Intellectual Property" are used, you've already conceded too much, and are fighting for local maxima. A stronger and more logical place to  have the debate is upstream of that: debate whether we should have these systems at all. I think the Amendment Strategy is clear enough, concrete enough, simple enough that you could get critical mass and start moving the debate upstream.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's say my hunch is wrong, and that momentum for an Amendment grows, and then in some trial regional experiment it turns out to be a bad idea, society would likely still benefit because the Intellectual Monopoly Industry would have to play defense for once, as opposed to constantly pushing for (and winning) extensions of monopolies. <em>The best defense is a good offense</em>. It's an adage, but there's usually some truth to adages.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="wisdom-a-tiny-language-for-great-advice.html">Wisdom: a Tiny Language for Great Advice</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">May 6, 2021 — </span>I am aware of two dialects for advice. I will call them FortuneCookie and Wisdom. Below are two examples of advice written in FortuneCookie.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">🥠 Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">🥠 Talking to users is the most important thing a startup can do.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here are two similar pieces of advice written in Wisdom:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">🔬 In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time – none, zero.
<a class="rightQuote" href="https://fs.blog/2014/06/charlie-munger-recommended-books/">Charlie Munger</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">🔬 I don't know of a single case of a startup that felt they spent too much time talking to users.
<a class="rightQuote" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5l-how-not-to-fail">Jessica Livingston</a></blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you only looked at certain dimensions, you could conclude the FortuneCookie versions are better. They are shorter. They are not attached to an author's name which seems to make them simpler.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But all things considered, the FortuneCookie versions are worthless compared to the Wisdom versions.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">✒️ Wisdom is a short piece of advice that is backed by a large dataset, is clear and easily testable.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Like FortuneCookie, Wisdom is some advice that can change your perspective or guide your decision making. No difference there.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Unlike FortuneCookie, Wisdom needs to be backed by a large dataaset. For example, in 2009 <a href="twelve-tips-to-master-programming-faster.html">I wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">🥠 to master programming, it might take you 10,000 hours of being actively coding or thinking about coding. </blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Ten years later, after <a href="https://github.com/breck7/30000hours">gathering data</a> I can now write:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">🔬 The programmers I respect the most, without exception, all practiced more than 30,000 hours^hours.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Even though the message is the same, the latter introduces a dataset to the problem. More importantly, it is instantly testable.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Wisdom can't just be the inclusion of a dataset. Without the testability, Munger's quote would be FortuneCookie:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">🥠 I've met hundreds of wise people who read all the time</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That's not the clearest advice. It certainly says that reading all the time won't rule out success, but it provides no guidance as to whether it is a necessary thing. The quote above leaves it ambiguous if he also knows of wise people who don't read all the time (we know from the real quote that he doesn't).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Sometimes you see a FortuneCookie idea evolving into Wisdom, where an advisor hasn't quite made it instantly testable yet but is proposing a way for the reader to test:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">🔬 If you look at a broad cross-section of startups -- say, 30 or 40 or more; which of team, product, or market is most important?...market is the most important factor in a startup's success or failure.
<a class="rightQuote" href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html">Marc Andreessen</a></blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Coming up with great pieces of Wisdom is hard. Like a good Proof of Work algorithm, Wisdom is hard to generate and easy to test. I know who Charlie Munger is, so I know he's probably met thousands of "wise people". All it would take would be for me to find just a single one that didn't read all the time to invalidate his advice. But I can't come up with any. I know who Jessica Livingston is and I know she's familiar with thousands of startups and I just need to find one who regrets spending so much time talking to users. But I can't think of any.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you have great experience, I urge you to not put it out there in the form of FortuneCookie, but chew on it until you can form it into Wisdom. These are very valuable contributions to our common blockchain.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="logeracy.html">Logeracy</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">April 26, 2021 — </span>I invented a new word: <strong><em>Logeracy</em></strong><a href="#note1" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I define it roughly as the ability to think in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">logarithms</a>. It mirrors the word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy">literacy</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Someone literate is fluent with reading and writing. Someone logerate is fluent with orders of magnitudes and the ubiquitous mathematical functions that dominate our universe.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Someone literate can take an idea and break it down into the correct symbols and words, someone logerate can take an idea and break it down into the correct classes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude">orders of magnitude</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Someone literate is fluent with terms like verb and noun and adjective. Someone logerate is fluent with terms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation">exponent</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(exponentiation)">base</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swan</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Someone literate can read an article and determine whether it makes sense grammatically. Someone logerate can read an article and determine whether it makes sense logarithmically.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Someone literate can read and write an address on the front of the envelope. Someone logerate can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation">back of the envelope</a>.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Illogeracy</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The opposite of logeracy is <em>illogeracy</em>: the inability to think in logarithms. An illogerate person is one who frequently gets the orders of magnitude wrong.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">An illogerate person may correctly understand parts 2 and 3 of a 3 term equation but get the first time-dependent part wrong and so get the whole thing wrong.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">An illogerate person can be penny wise pound foolish.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">An illogerate person treats all parts of an argument as important.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">An illogerate person may mistake one part of a sin wave for a trend.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">An illogerate is one who may be familiar with exponentials but unfamiliar with sigmoids</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Measuring Logeracy</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">No country or organization measures logeracy yet<a href="#note2" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage2"><sup>2</sup></a>. I don't know which countries are the most logerate, but for now I would guess there will be a strong correlation between the engineering prowess of a country and it's level of logeracy.</p>
</div></div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="literacy.jpg" target="_blank"  ><img src="literacy.jpg" width="1440" height="1068" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Countries have been measuring <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy">literacy</a> for hundreds of years now. As the chart above shows, the world has made great progress in reducing illiteracy. 200 years ago, ~90% of the world was illiterate. Now that's down to ~10%. If you break it down further by country, you'll see that in countries like Japan and the United States literacy is over 99%.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The upside of logeracy</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Logeracy is how engineering works. Good engineers fluently and effortlessly work across scales. If we want to be an interplanetary species, we first must become a more logerate species.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Logeracy makes decision making simple and fast (figure out the classes of the options, and then the decision should be obvious).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You don't get wealthy without logeracy. An illogerate and his money are soon parted. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest">Compound interest</a> is a tool of the logerate. Money doesn't buy happiness, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">logarithm of money</a> does.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Where is logeracy currently taught well?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My knowledge here is limited. I know Computer Science students could be the ones taught logeracy best. We are taught it by a different name. CS students are repeatedly taught to think in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">Big O notation</a><a href="#note3" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage3"><sup>3</sup></a>. In Computer Science you are constantly working with phenomena across vastly different scales so logeracy is critical if you want to be successful.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps its electrical engineers, or astronomers, or aerospace engineers. These folks are frequently working with vast scale differences so logeracy is required.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In finance, 100% of successful early stage technology investors I know of are highly logerate.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It would be interesting to see logeracy rates across industries. Perhaps measuring that would lead to progress.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">How much logeracy is the average person taught?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My high school chemistry teacher first exposed me to logeracy when she taught me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation">Scientific Notation</a>. That was probably the only real drilling I got in logeracy before getting into Computer Science. Scientific Notation is a handy notation and a great introduction to logeracy, but logeracy is so important that it probably deserves its own dedicated class in high schools where it is drilled repeatedly from many difference perspectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What are some good books for improving logeracy?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I would recommend "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn" by Hamming. That's maybe the most logerate book I've ever read. I also love Taleb's Incerto series (ie Fooled by Randomness, Black Swan, Antifragile...).</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Is logeracy fractal?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Yes<a href="#note4" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Some industries, like engineering, demand logeracy. A randomly selected engineer is likely to be 10x+ more logerate than a randomly selected member of the general population. But what about the distribution of logeracy within a field? Only recently did it occur to me how fractal logeracy is. A surprising number of engineers I've worked with seem to compartmentalize their logerate thinking to their work and act illogerate in fields outside of their own. In Hamming's book I was surprised to read over and over again how very few engineers he worked with (at the world's top "logerate" organizations) operated with his level of logeracy. Logeracy seems fractal.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Can you be too logerate?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I don't think so. However, I do believe you can be out of balance. One needs to be <em>linerate</em><a href="#note5" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage5"><sup>5</sup></a> as well as logerate. We have so many adages for people that focus <em>too much</em> on the dominant-in-time term of an equation and not enough about the linear but dominant-now parts. Adages like "head in the clouds", "crackpot", "ahead of her time". We also have common wisdom for how to avoid that trap "a journey of a single step...", "do things that don't scale", so it is likely that being extremely logerate without lineracy is a real pitfall to be aware of.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What about the term Numeracy?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I read Innumeracy and Beyond Numeracy by Paulos over a decade ago<a href="#note6" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage6"><sup>6</sup></a>. I love those books (and it's been too long since I reread them).</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Numeracy is a good term. Logeracy is a much better term. Someone logerate but innumerate often makes small mistakes. Someone numerate but illogerate often makes large mistakes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Numeracy is sort of like knowing the letters of the alphabet. Knowing the letters is a necessary thing on the path to literacy, but not that useful by itself. Likewise, being numerate is a step to being logerate, but the real bang for your buck comes with logeracy.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Illogeracy Epidemic</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Literacy without logeracy is dangerous. My back-of-the-envelope guess is that over 80% of writers and editors in today's media are illogerate (or perhaps are just acting like it in public). 2020 was an eye opening year for me. I had vastly underestimated how prevalent illogeracy was in our society. I am tired of talking about the pandemic, but to this day in the news I see a steady stream of "leaders" obliviously promoting their illogeracy, and walking around outside I see a huge percentage of my fellow citizens demonstrating the same. I would guess currently over 60% of America is illogerate. The funny thing is it may be correlated with education—if you are educated as a non-engineer you perhaps are more likely to be illogerate than a high school dropout, because you rely too much on your literacy and are oblivious to your illogeracy. I am very interested to see data on rates of logeracy.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Let's get to 99%+ logeracy</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I wrote my first post on <a href="https://breckyunits.com/orders-of-magnitude.html">Orders of Magnitudes</a> nearly twelve years ago, back in 2009. At the time I didn't have a concise way to put it, so instead I advised "think in Orders of Magnitude". Now I have a better way to put it: <strong>become logerate</strong>. I wonder what wonderful things humankind will achieve when we have logeracy rates like our literacy rates.</p>
</div></div>

<p  id="note1"class="scrollParagraph">1 I was very surprised to be the one to invent the word logeracy(<a href="logeracy.png">proof</a>). Only needed to change 2 letters in a popular word.

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="how-to-fix-the-cdc.html">How to fix the CDC</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 30, 2021 — </span><strong>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a> needs to move to Git</strong>. The CDC needs to move pretty much <em>everything to Git</em>. And they should do it <strong>with urgency</strong>. They should make it a priority to never again publish anything without a link to a Git repo. Not just papers, but also datasets and press releases. It doesn't matter under what account or on what service the repos are republished to; what matters is that <em>every CDC publication needs a link to a backing Git repo</em>.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">How do you explain Git to a government leader?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Git is the "Global Information Tracker". It is software that does three things that anyone can understand 1) git makes lying hard 2) git makes sharing the truth easy 3) git makes fixing mistakes easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why does the CDC need to move to Git?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Because the CDC's publications are currently full of misrepresentations, make it very hard to share the truth, and are full of hard to fix mistakes. Preprints, Weekly Reports, FAQs, press releases, all of these things need links to the Gits.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Who builds on Git?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The whole world <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/bharry/the-largest-git-repo-on-the-planet/">now builds on Git</a>. The CDC is far behind the times. Even Microsoft Windows, the biggest proprietary software project in the world, now builds on Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What is Git?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> is an open source, very fast, very powerful piece of software originally created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> (the same guy who created Linux) and led by <a href="https://github.com/gitster">Junio C Hamano</a> that makes extensive use of principles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">How can the CDC rapidly move to Git?</h4>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Double Down on Internal Leaders</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The <a href="https://github.com/CDCgov">CDC's GitHub account</a> has 169 repos and 10 people (and I'm told many hundreds more Git users). I would immediately promote every person working on these repos. (There are probably one or two jokers in there but who cares, it won't matter, just promote them all). Give them everything they need to be successful. Give them raises. Tell them part of their new job is to get everything the CDC is invovled with published to Git. This is probably really the only thing you need to do, and these people can lead it from there.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Change Funding Requirements</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Provide a hard deadline announcing that you will stop all funding for any current grant recipient, researcher, or company doing business of any kind who isn't putting their sponsored work on a publically available Git server and linking to it in all releases.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Education and Training</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The CDC has 10,600 employees, so buying them all $20 worth of great paper books on learning how to use Git would only cost $201,200. For the most part, these are highly educated people who are autodidacts and can probably learn enough with just some books and websites, but for those who learn better via courses or videos you can budget another $30 per person for those. Then budget to ensure everyone is paid for the time spent learning. We are still talking about far less than 1% of the CDC's annual budget.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why the urgency?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Because the CDC not only failed at it's mission by not stopping COVID, but it continues to mishandle it. Mistake after mistake. Miscommunication after miscommunication. I just shook my head looking over an amateur hour report that they just put out. It's sad and their number one priority should be to regain trust and to do that they need to focus on the most trustworthy tool in information today: git.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Specific Examples</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm adding two very clear and specific examples to illustrate the problem. But my sense is the problem is prolific.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">#1 - COVID-19 in kids vs the Flu</h2>

<blockquote class="scrollQuote">For young children, especially children younger than 5 years old, the risk of serious complications is higher for flu compared with COVID-19.

<p class="scrollParagraph">This statement appeared on the CDC's website for more than a year. As it should have. Every big dataset I've looked at agrees with this, from the very <a href="https://twitter.com/breckyunits/status/1228117546974371840">first COVID-19 data dump</a> in February 2020.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I started actively sharing and quoting that CDC page in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210820184423/https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm">August 2021</a>. Coincidentally or not, within days they <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm">removed that quote</a>. There is no record of why they made the change. In fact the updated page misleadingly states "Page last reviewed: June 7, 2021", despite the August edit*.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">To recap, they quietly <em>reversed</em> the most critical piece of contextual advice on how parents should think about COVID-19 in relation to their children. No record, no explanation. (In case you are wondering, the data has not changed, and the latest data aligns with the original statement which they removed. Perhaps the change was made for political reasons).</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">#2 - Changing the definition of vaccine</h2>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The second example is well <a href="https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/a-lawsuit-in-three-acts">documented</a> elsewhere, but the CDC changed their online definition of the word "vaccine", again perhaps for political reasons. That sort of thing seems like the kind of change that maybe should have some audit trail behind it, no?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Conclusion</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I used to take it for granted that we could trust the CDC. That made life easier. Health is so important but so, so complex. I would love to trust them again, and would have more confidence if they were using the best tools for trust we have.</p>

</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Introduction</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 11, 2021 — </span>I have been a FitBit user for many years but did not know the story behind the company. Recently came across a podcast by Guy Raz called <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This</a>. In this <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/841267648/fitbit-james-park">episode</a> he interviews James Park who explains the story of FitBit.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I loved the story so much but couldn't find a transcript, so made the one below. Subtitles (and all mistakes) added by me.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Transcript of <em>How I Built This</em> with James Park</h1>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="jamesPark.jpeg" target="_blank"  ><img src="jamesPark.jpeg" width="275" height="183" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> From NPR, It's How I Built This. A show about innovators, entrepreneurs, idealists, and the stories behind the movements. Here we go. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, how the Nintendo Wii inspired James Park to build a device and then a company that would have a huge and lasting influence on the health and fitness industry, Fitbit.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's taken me a few weeks to get motivated about exercise. This whole pandemic thing just had me in a state of anxiety and it messed with my routine, but I was inspired to jump back into it about two weeks ago, after watching my 11-year-old proudly announce his daily step count recorded on his Fitbit. Now, fitness isn't all that important to him. He's 11. But the gamification of fitness, the idea that it could be fun to hit 5,000 or 10,000 steps a day, that's what matters.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This is the stroke of insight James Park had soon after he stood in line at a Best Buy in San Francisco to buy the brand new video game system called Nintendo Wii. And you'll hear James explain the story a bit later, but what he realized playing the Wii is that you could actually change human behavior around exercise if you turned it into a game. And the thing is, up until James Park and his co-founder Eric Friedman founded Fitbit in 2007, there really weren't any digital fitness trackers that were designed that way. It took a few years for James and Eric to gain traction, but by 2010, 2011, Fitbit took off. At one point, their fitness devices accounted for nearly 70% of the market. And by 2015, the company was valued at more than $10 billion. But that same year, the Apple Watch was released, and Fitbit and its market share got hammered. When I spoke to James Park a few days ago, he was in San Francisco, living in an Airbnb.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I'm in a temporary Airbnb because the place that I typically live in has been flooded out by a malfunctioning washing machine. I woke up at it 1:00 AM</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> In the middle of this whole thing, flooded washing machine went... You woke up in the middle of the night and there was water everywhere?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I know. Amazing timing. Yeah. I woke up at 1:00 AM, and I just woke up to the sound of water gushing everywhere. It was coming through the ceiling. It was a massive flood.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Okay. So on top of sheltering in place and running his company remotely, James had to move out of his apartment in the middle of the night and then set up the microphone and gear we sent him for this interview. He started to tell us about his parents who immigrated from Korea when James was four. Back in Korea, his dad had been an electrical engineer and his mom was a nurse. But as with many immigrants, they had a hard time getting those same jobs in the US. So instead, his parents became small business owners.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Growing Up (1977)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> The first conscious memory I have is, my parents actually own the wig shop in downtown Cleveland.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow. How did they get into that? Was it just a way to earn a living?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. I think a way to earn a living and the typical immigrant story is you have friends who live in the country that you're immigrating to. And I think my dad had a friend who worked in wig wholesaling. That's where he started out. There were selling wigs to people who live in downtown Cleveland, African-Americans, mostly women. And I remember my mom, she'd spend a lot of time just looking through black fashion magazine, styling hair, beating them, et cetera.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> They had a wig shop, dry cleaners, a fish market. At one point we moved to Atlanta and they ran an ice cream shop there. We sold track suits, starter jackets, fitted baseball caps, thick gold chains.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Sort of hip-hop urban wear, right? Like FUBU, and stuff like that?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Yep. They sold FUBU jeans. Yep. I remember that. And they could switch from one genre or one type of business to another and really not skip a beat.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And were your parents, did they expect you perform well at school? Was that just a given?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I think they had incredibly high expectations then as a kid. I think I remember my mom telling me when I was pretty young, I don't know, five, six, seven, that she expected me to go to Harvard.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. I don't think I quite knew what that meant back then, but you could tell that their expectations were pretty high from the very beginning.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Dropping out of Harvard (1998)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> James did in fact meet his mom's expectations. He did go to Harvard. He put in three years studying computer science, but after his junior year, he got a summer internship at Morgan Stanley and then ended up deciding to start his own business. And then we had hoped to finish his college degree, he never went back.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I always had a little bit of a stubborn streak, and that was when I was trying to figure things out, try to think of ideas. I think there is a lot of opportunity, a lot of problems to be solved. I was also looking for a co-founder at the time. So those are two critical ingredients, an idea and a co-founder.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> This is 1998. This is not 2015 when these kinds of conversations seem so common. This was unusual in 1998 for a young person. It was just less common for a young person to just sort of say, "I'm going to look into a tech startup and try to find a co-founder and just take some time to think about these things." I would imagine your parents were nervous. I'd be nervous if my 20-year-old said to me, "I'm not going to go back to college and I don't really know what I'm going to do, but I'm just going to think about it."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. They were understandably pretty upset, angry even I'd say. And the irony is that, they probably took away more incredible personal risk moving from Korea to United States and running these series of businesses, which are commonly done, but not easy in themselves and pretty high risk. But I do understand obviously the perspective at the time.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The eCommerce Start Up</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Okay. You decide you want to start something up, and I think you eventually landed on e-commerce, right?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. That was not a groundbreaking thing at the time. Obviously, Amazon was around, et cetera. A lot of e-commerce startups, but settled on this idea of making e-commerce a lot more seamless and frictionless and came up at this idea of a electronic wallet that would automatically make purchases for you. It would work with a lot of different e-commerce sites and the goal there was that we would take a cut of every transaction.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Right. And what was the company called?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> That was interesting. We originally named it Kapoof, that was how it was incorporated, until a lot of people said, "That might not be the best name for a company." Sounds like, we called it Kapoof because it sounded like magic, et cetera, Kapoof. Things are done. Your transaction is completed by Kapoof.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> It sounds like, "Kapoof, your money is gone."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> "You've no more money."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Exactly. Time of crazy names like Yahoo, et cetera. But we decided to change our name at some point and we changed it to Epesi, which was so Swahili for fast. And so that was the ultimate name of the company.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Raising a "few million" dollars</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And you guys were actually able to raise a fair amount of money. Right?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We did. We ended up raising a few million dollars from some individuals and some from some venture capital firms as well. And we hired some people. We found a cool renovated firehouse. That was-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Nice. Nice</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> ... Really amazing place to hang out in for many, many, many hours of the day. And we hired up to, it was close to about 30 people.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meeting his eventual FitBit cofounder</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow. One super important thing that happened there was you met Eric Friedman, right? The guy that you would eventually launch Fitbit with.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I did. And that's probably one of the more fortunate turns in my life. Eric, we didn't know each other at all before the company, Epesi. He was actually just graduating from Yale in computer science. And I interviewed him. I liked him a lot. And he ended up ultimately becoming the first employee at the company.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Okay. So you hire Eric, and I think the company lasted 18 months, or a little less than two years.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. About two years, and a lot of ups and downs during that period. If I had to think back, I would attribute two-thirds of the challenges and problems we faced as a business to myself, just because I had never managed people. I didn't really know how to run a business, even it was only the technology side. And at some point the dot-com crash happened. And all of our potential customers, the whole industry, the whole economy started taking a downturn.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Dot Com Bust (2001)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So this company spirals out in 2001. And when that happened, did you think, "Okay, I should go back to college now and finish my degree." Or, "I got to start something else." Where was your head at that point?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Well, it was a really challenging personal time for me. Towards the end of the company, we obviously had to lay off most of the company, and trying to doing it in a way that was compassionate was really, really difficult. I don't think the thought of entering school or going back to school popped back into my head at all. And I don't know why. I think it was because, despite this very emotional failure, I knew this was what I wanted to do. I had a firm conviction about that. And so I knew I wasn't going to go back.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So what'd you do?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Getting Real Jobs</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We all ended up working at the same place actually. It was a company, a pretty large company called Dun & Bradstreet at the time. Very stable company. And we were all fortunate to be able to find work there as engineers.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So daytime working at Dun & Bradstreet, and then what? At night sitting around just-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Brainstorming. Yeah. We go into work during the daytime and then we'd come home in the evenings, code different things, try different things out. So it was a pretty intense. I think, in terms of the numbers of hours, I don't think anything changed from our first startup to trying to figure this next one out.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Startup #2 (2002)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And before too long, you decide to do another startup. This time, with Eric Friedman from your previous company, and then another guy named Gokhan Kutlu. I think this was what? 2003, 2004?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. This was about 2002 actually.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Okay. And this time the startup was a photo editing platform, sharing platform. What was it called?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> The company's name at the time was called HeyPix and the product itself was called electric shoe box because a lot of people put their old photos in shoe boxes and this was just going to be a digital.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Yes. I still have them in shoe boxes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> You'll digitize them probably.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> I should. I know.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. And so electric shoe box, which is going to be a digital version of your shoe box.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And what could you do?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Well, there are digital cameras were coming about back then. It still wasn't easy to connect them, upload photos. It was getting easier, but nowhere near what it is today, obviously. The whole idea of electric shoe box was to make the whole process of getting photos off your camera a lot easier. And more importantly, we wanted to make the process of sharing these photos with your friends and family a lot easier.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So did you raise money for the product, for the electric shoe box?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We did. We ended up raising money primarily from one of my friends from middle school who was a mutual fund manager in Boston. And so, he put in a bit of money, not a lot. I think about, at least for him, it was about 100,000. And we had a bunch of savings ourselves that we were going to use. And in anticipation, I also opened up a few more credit cards as well.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And it was just really the three of you, sitting at your computers and just tapping the keys all night?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> You pretty much nailed it. I mean, all we did was, we would wake up in the morning, walk over to the third bedroom and just start typing away for 12 hours. We'd take meal breaks. I remember Eric did a lot of cooking. So we'd eat our dinners on some TV stands watching TV. That was a good break for us, watching Seinfeld, and then go to bed and then repeat it the following day.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow. All right. So you come up with this product, and by the way, how are you going to make money off of this thing? This is a free service. How were you going to pay for it?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I guess, it would be called freemium software. It would be free for a period of time, and the trial period would end and then you'd have to submit your credit card information to continue using the software.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Got it. Got it.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The pivotal $300 Press Release</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And so, our primary goal was making sure that a lot of people knew about the software. So we put it on shareware sites, et cetera. And then we spent a lot of time debating, "Should we send out a press release?" And I remember it was a huge debate because sending out a press release was going to be about $300. And that was the level of expense that required a vigorous debate at the time. So we said, "You know what? Without getting the product known, how are we going to be successful?" So we wrote up a press release and we put it out. And actually it was probably the most pivotal decision we ever made in that company's history.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Because?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> The first email came in a few hours later. I think the second one came in a day later. But we got two emails, one from CNET, which is a huge digital publishing company. And then we got another email from Yahoo saying, "Hey, we just heard about this launch of this software product. And we'd like to talk to you guys more about it."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Exactly. This was coming from their corporate development arms, which typically deals with M&A, with buying, buying companies.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah, exactly. We were like, "Whoa, this is magic. How did this happen?"</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Bought by CNET for millions (2005)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111265965498397840">2005, it gets purchased by CNET</a>. They make an offer to buy this company, buy this product from you guys and you sell it to CNET. Was that life-changing money? Did that mean that you never had to work again?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It was definitely a good acquisition for all of us at the time. Remember we were three guys working out of our apartments. I was at the time about $40,000 in credit card debt as well. We were down to some desperate times and we were negotiating numbers and they threw out a number which was, their first offer was 4 million, and we were like, "Whoa, that's amazing."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Like, "God, I can't believe we built something that's worth this much at the time." We were just stunned. And then, we quickly got to, "Okay, how do we negotiate something better?"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So you sell your company to CNET in 2005 and you've got some money in your pocket. And you move to San Francisco to work for CNET. Did you enjoy it? I mean, it was probably a huge company at this point, right?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It was a huge company, but I think the moment, at least for me, that I moved to San Francisco, I instantly fell in love with the city. And CNET, even though was a larger company, I actually found it to be an amazing time. I learned a lot. I got some management training. I ended up managing a small team of people. Learned a lot about how technology scales to millions and millions of users. How you market products. I really enjoyed my experience there. I think it was pretty formative.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Nintendo Wii and Leaving CNET (2007)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Why did you leave CNET?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We left CNET just because of, I guess you could call it a bolt of lightning in some ways. It was December of 2006 and Nintendo had just announced the Nintendo Wii. And I remember coming home, putting it together. At the time Nintendo had come up with this really innovative control system, using motion sensors, accelerometers to serve as inputs into a game. And after using it, especially in Wii Fit, which was a sports game. I thought, "Wow, this is incredible. This is amazing. This is magical. You can use sensors in this way. You can use it to bring people together." Particularly for Wii Fit, it was a way of getting people active, of getting them moving together. And I was just blown away by this whole idea, really excited about. I couldn't stop thinking about it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And after some time of playing Wii Fit and the Wii and a lot of other games, I thought, "This is great. It's in my living room, but what if I want to take this outside of the living room?" And I kept thinking about that idea, like-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> "How do you take Wii Fit outside?"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Outside. Exactly.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Genesis of Fitbit (2007</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I couldn't let it go. And I ultimately ended up calling up Eric and we started talking about this idea for hours and hours and we couldn't stop talking about it. It's like, "How do we capture this magic and make it more portable? How do we give it to people 24-7?" And that was really the Genesis of Fitbit.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So the technology, I mean, pedometers have been around forever. Was that where your head was going, or thinking, "Okay, maybe we just create an electronic pedometer?" But I think even electronic pedometers were around in 2007, right?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Existing Pedometer</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. Pedometers were definitely around back then. Actually, they had been around for probably 100 years. One of the things though is that, they weren't something that people would want to use or to wear. They were very big. They were pretty ugly. They looked like medical devices.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> A lot of senior citizens used them.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. They weren't a very aspirational device. It wasn't something that people were excited to use. And so, I think that's why that whole category of device just never really had any innovation. And there are also much higher-end devices. You could buy much fancier running watches, like GPS watches, et cetera. But those are really expensive for people. There are 300, $400 at the time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So you had this idea, and that means you had to raise money. And this is going to be the third time now that you've had to do that for a business. And I think I read that you raised $400,000 to launch this. I mean, I don't know a lot about hardware, but that doesn't seem like it was going to take you very far in building a physical product.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> As we quickly found out, yes, we had grossly underestimated the cost of taking this to market.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And what did that initial amount of money, how far did they get you into actually conceding of what this product was going to be?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It got us to a prototype, write some rudimentary software, get some industrial design concepts done and some models.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> What did the prototype look like? Did it look like a Fitbit?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It looked absolutely nothing like a Fitbit. There are two things, there was actual, somewhat working prototype and then there was an industrial design model.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Which was a piece of plastic.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Plastic, and metal that was supposed to look like the ultimate product. And so, that actually looked really, really nice.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> But it didn't work?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. It was totally nonfunctional. And we'd always have to tell people before showing, "This doesn't work here." Because they get all excited looking at the model. "No, no, no. That doesn't work." The thing that actually worked looked like something that came out of a garage, literally.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> What did it look like?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The prototype</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It was rectangular circuit board, a little bit smaller than your. And it had a motion sensor, it had a radio, it had a microcontroller, which was the brains of the product. And it had a rudimentary case, which was a balsa with box.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow. So you would take to investors, a circuit board and a balsa wood box as your prototype?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. That was the prototype. And actually that was what we had demoed. When we first announced the company, that was the prototype that was actually being used at the announcement.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow. I mean, how did you even get it to that point? Because you guys are both software engineers, how did you develop a physical product that even such a crude prototype could track movement? Did you have other people help you do that?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> That was our big task was to find the right people who could help us. I knew the founder of a really great industrial design firm in San Francisco called <a href="https://www.newdealdesign.com/">New Deal Design</a>. His name is Gadi Amit. And then on the algorithm side, because it was going to take a lot of sophisticated algorithms to translate this motion data to actual data that users would be able to understand, I ended up asking my best friend from college, because he was in grad school at Harvard at the time. And he said, "Wait, I think I might know somebody." And it ended up being his teaching fellow, his name was Shelton. And we talked and I was like, "Wow, this guy is super smart. We need to get him working on the algorithms." So he ended up working on the side while doing his PHD, helping us out with a lot of the software.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> I mean, you leave CNET in 2007, and you've got 400,000 to come up with a prototype that quickly run out of that. So it's 2008, and you're trying to raise money, how much did you raise?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Raising $2M (2008)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I think our first round was about $2 million.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Which was not going to take you that far if you wanted to develop a physical product that was super sophisticated, a piece of hardware.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We thought we could do it. We thought we knew a little bit more about the hardware business. We put together another business plan budget. It was actually a pretty challenging time to raise money as well because-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Oh, with the financial crisis. Yeah.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Exactly. It was the fall of 2008, when we were trying to raise money. One of the, I guess the good and bad things about VCs is, the good thing about VCs is they're incredibly healthy people. They're super fit. But it also made it difficult for a lot of them to understand the value of the product because what we were trying to do was, it wasn't a product meant for super athletic people, it was really meant to help normal people become more active, become healthier, et cetera. And it was hard for a lot of them to grasp why that was valuable. They'd ask, "Well, did it do X or did it do Y and did it do Z?" And we'd say, "No, it doesn't do any of that." And so it was very difficult for a lot of these super-fit VCs to understand the value of the product, even though a lot of them claim they don't try to put their own bias on these products. It's naturally human to do that.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And did you know right away that this was going to be... I mean, now Fitbit's are watches mainly. They're wrists, there on your wrist. But at that time, you were thinking that this was just going to be something you would clip to your clothing?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. Something to clip to your clothing for men. And then what we found out in talking to a lot of women was that they wanted to tuck it away somewhere hidden. They didn't want people to see it. And we said, "Okay, where would you want to put it?" And said, "Well, a lot of our pants don't have pockets, so it can't be in our pocket." And so the preferred place was actually on their bra. So a lot of the physical design that we had to think about in the early days was how to come up with a product that would be very slim, slender, and clipped people's bra.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And hidden.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And hidden and clipped the bras pretty easily.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And by the way, how did you come up with the name Fitbit?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Buying FitBit.com from a Russian for $2,000</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It's never easy to name a company, and it's even more challenging just because of domain names. That's typically a lot of the limiting factor in naming a great company. And so, we would spend hours and hours and days just going through different permutations of names, and some awful ones as well. At some point we got onto a fruit theme. So we were thinking like Fitberry or Berryfit or Fitcado. Just some really awful names.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> The Fitcado.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> The Fitcado. Yes. History might've turned out a lot differently for sure. I was just taking a nap in my office one afternoon. I think I was actually napping on the rug because I was so tired. And I woke up and it just hit me, it was Fitbit. And the next challenge was actually the domain name. The domain name was not available. And it was owned by the guy in Russia. And I'm like, "Oh my god, how are we going to get this domain name? We'll just email the guy and see what happens." And he said, "Well, how much are you willing to offer?" And I said, "Oh god, I don't know. How about 1,000 bucks?" And he's like, "Oof, how about 10,000?" And I said, "Oh, I don't know. That sounds like a lot. How about 2,000?" And he's like, "Oh, okay. 2000, deal." I think it was literally two or three emails that we sent back and forth in this negotiation.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Probably the best $2,000 you ever spent in your life, except for the 300 you spent on the press release a couple years earlier.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Definitely a good return.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> You've probably spent many millions of dollars on other things in your life that were not as good of a deal as that $2,000.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. It's tens of thousands on naming consultants and focus groups and trademark searches and all of that. It's kind of funny.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Hey, as they say, small companies, small problems, big company, big problems.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Doing a consumer hardware startup before KickStarter</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So where do you begin? I mean, you got to make it, you got to find a factory, you got to find designers. Where do you go?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Very good question. We obviously had zero connections. The challenge though, was not actually the connections to the manufacturers, but finding a manufacturer who we could actually convince to build this product because we didn't have a background in hardware. And so, would they actually want to work with us? That was the biggest concern at the time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So how did you find them?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We went out to China. We went out to Singapore. And we were never going to be able to get the Foxconn's.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> You had to go to a smaller place.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We had to go to a smaller place, who'd be more nimble, more flexible, who'd want to take a financial risk. And we finally found a great manufacturer based in Singapore called Racer Technologies. And the good thing is actually, it was the best of all worlds, the headquarters was in Singapore. Most of the management team and the engineering staff was in Singapore, but they had manufacturing facilities that were in Indonesia. The labor there was going to be lower cost than in Singapore.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> All right. So 2008, you've got the name Fitbit, you go to <a href="https://youtu.be/RRR26GPpQ4A?t=218">TechCrunch50</a> to present, to unveil this product. And what was the product that you were offering? Well, you said, "All right, we've got to think of the Fitbit and it does this." What did you say it did at that point?</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="fitbit2008.jpg" target="_blank"  ><img src="fitbit2008.jpg" width="1724" height="1034" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Our pitch to the crowd at TechCrunch, and ultimately to our consumer was that, it was a product that would track your steps, distance, calories, and how much you slept and would answer some basic questions about your health, "Was I active enough today? Did I get enough sleep? What do I need to do to lose weight," et cetera. And one of the more important aspects was this idea of a community as well. "Join other people who own Fitbits, your friends and family, and you could compete with each other." And it was all wireless. You didn't really have to do anything. All you'd have to do is wear this device, don't even think about it, and all this magic would happen. That was the promise of Fitbit at the time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> There was a lot of excitement there, but I'm wondering, were you nervous to do these presentations? Did you have to prepare like crazy, or did you just find your ability to be this person you had to be on stage when you got up there?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah, I think there was no other choice. It was just something we had to do. And I think-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Are you better at it than Eric, or is Eric better at it than you?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I think we're both good in our different ways. It just fell upon me. I don't even know how we decide those things. But actually, what was running through our minds, was not what we were going to say and how we're going to say it, but whether the demo would actually work on stage, because again, it was a little sketchy. It was still very early. It was still in the wooden box.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> In the balsa wood box.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Balsa wood box phase. So we were just worried that the demo would just fail or crash.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> But it worked.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The TechCrunch pitch and 2,000 preorders</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It worked, and actually it did crash in the middle of the presentation because the whole demo was about me walking on stage, the device would be collecting stats. And at one point I would turn to Eric and say, "Hey, Eric, why don't you refresh the page and show that all the stats have been uploaded." Magically, do this wireless connection. And so, the demo actually crashed while I was talking, and Eric was fiercely trying to reboot his computer during this period and I don't even know anything about it. But ultimately, the demo did work. And so, to many people, it seemed like magic. Literally, people started clapping. It was really amazing.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Originally, right before TechCrunch, Eric and I, we made just a verbal bet. "How many pre-orders are we going to get after this conference when we announce and make the company public?" And I think Eric said, "I think we'll get like five pre-orders." So it's like, "The device isn't even available. People are going to have to give us their credit card information." And I said, "Nah, you know what? I'm not as pessimistic. I think there's going to be like 10, 15, 20." And so we got off stage, and by the end of the day, we had about 2000 pre-orders.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow. When we come back in just a moment, James and Eric have a prototype in the balsa wood box and they don't exactly know how they are going to get from there to filling thousands of pre-orders. But a lot of people are expecting them in time for Christmas. Stay with us, I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to How I Built This from NPR.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Hey, welcome back to How I Built This from NPR, I'm guy Raz. So it's 2008, and James and his co-founder Eric Friedman show off their Fitbit prototype at TechCrunch, and it makes a huge splash. The problem is, they have no finished product. They haven't even figured out how they're going to make it and pre-orders are pouring in.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Being Open and Transparent</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And they just kept coming in. It was crazy. We were like, "Oh my god, it's not just dozens of these units we have to build, it's now thousands, and more and more every day." And so we were still thinking Christmas of that year that we were going to start shipping out units, and it rapidly became clear to us that we weren't going to make Christmas. And so, we're thinking, "Okay, how do we keep all these people happy while we pull this off?" So this was before Kickstarter and Indiegogo and all that. We had to improvise. We were like, "Okay, why don't we just blog about the whole process and just be very open and transparent about it." So we started a blog, and I wrote maybe weekly updates on how things were going, challenges and delays that we were facing.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And I was really surprised, actually, it worked. It made people understand what we were going through. They're literally seeing the thing being made, the sausage being made behind the scenes. And I think that kept people really engaged throughout the process.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So you have basically a bunch of contractors and freelancers and you guys are going back and forth to Asia. You got people working on the software to transmit the data to the web. You've got some people working on the hardware, presumably, in Singapore trying shrink down the motherboard to something that is two inches by one half inch. And were you just constantly running into failures? You would think that, "Oh, here it is." And then somebody would hit the go button and then it would just fizzle out, it wouldn't work?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. I can't even enumerate the number of challenges with the product that we had.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Please start.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Manufacturing in Asia</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> In some ways a lot of people, I think when you think about hardware, it's like, "Oh, I'll find a manufacturer in China. I'll throw over a design."</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Yeah, right. No problem.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> "They'll just run with it."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And then, "Just send me the bill," and then it's done.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And they'll just crank out thousands, tens of thousands of this. But that's never-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And that works if it's a suitcase, we've done a way. It works if it's that thing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> If it's that thing or something that's very similar to something that they've built before.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Right.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Well, that's a different story than this thing that this manufacturer never had built before.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So they would send you things and say, "Yep, we got it." And then you would get it and it sucked. It just didn't work.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. We wouldn't wait for them to send it. I mean, either myself or Eric would be in Indonesia or Singapore at any given time. We'd trade off different weeks. And we were out there on the production lines pretty much inspecting every part of the process.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> But were you convinced this thing was going to work or did you have doubt?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I was absolutely convinced that it was going to happen.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> You had no doubts that this-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I had no doubts because we were getting proof every day that this was something that was going to be big. And I think the first evidence of that was at TechCrunch where we had 2,000 pre-orders and we were getting pre-orders every day. I think by the summer time, we had about 25,000 pre-orders at $100 per unit. That's a fair amount of revenue if we could ship these units.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And how much was it going to cost you to make each unit?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> That was a very good question. We didn't know that. Hopefully, under $100.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> You didn't know? You were selling them for $100, but you didn't know how much it was going to cost you.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We had a sense of the bill of materials. I think we were trying to shoot for a gross margin of about 50%. So we're targeting the full cost of the product, including shipping, et cetera, being no more than $50. That's what we were targeting.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Which is a lot. That's high. It's a high cost.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It's a high cost, but that was a cost at which we felt we could sustain ourselves as a business.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> How did you and Eric manage your relationship and friendship? I mean, with the stress of this delay and inability to meet demand and all these, was there tension at all between the two of you, or you guys totally are on the same page?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Importance of cofounders</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I don't think there was that much tension. I mean, a lot of stress, but not tension. I think we trust in our ability to help each other out. And there are periods when either of us would be pretty down on the company and the product. And luckily, we weren't down both at the same time. And that's why it helps, I think, to have a co-founder.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So there were times where you were really down and he could give you a pep talk and.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Exactly. And then I'd wonder why he wasn't down. And there're some pretty dark times right before we shipped. I remember we were months before we thought we could finally get the first unit off the production line. And I was sitting in my hotel room in Singapore, and I was testing out one of the prototype builds that that Racer had produced and the radio range was not good at all. It was supposed to have a range-</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Hardware is Hard</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> 10 feet or 15 feet?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> That was the hope that it would have 15 to 20 feet range, but the range was actually two inches.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Oh god. Wait, so the antenna in the device had a two inch range.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. It would only work at two inches. And I'm thinking, we've got to ship this holiday season. I've got tens of thousands of these people waiting.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Oh god.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And so, I'm just freaking out in hotel room.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> You might as well have a cord and just plug it in.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Exactly, exactly. I couldn't sleep that night obviously. And I took the unit apart. I had a multimeter and I was measuring different voltages and currents. And what I realized was, huh, the cable for the display was flexible and long enough that maybe it was actually trooping down and touching the antenna and that was causing-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> That was creating interference.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Creating interference. And I could see that when you put the whole thing together, that it might troop down. And I thought, "Okay, how do I create a shim that would prop the antenna?" So I went to the bathroom, grabbed some toilet paper, rolled a little bit of it in a ball and stuffed it between the antenna and the display cable, put the device back together. And it started working. The range was great.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow. So you had to separate one wire from the antenna and that was it, with toilet paper?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> With toilet paper. Yeah, that was it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And I still couldn't sleep. So as early as possible, the following morning I raced into our manufacturing and said, "Okay, I think I found the problem," but obviously a toilet paper is not a scalable high volume situation. So they went back and figured out how they could make this manufacturable. So they ended up creating these little tiny tie cut pieces of rubber that they would glue onto the circuit board to keep the antenna away from the display cable.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow. Wow. So that was, basically, was just, inserting something in there and then it worked?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah, it wasn't exactly duct tape, but that was the equivalent of duct tape</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> It was pretty close.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It was pretty close. Yeah.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So you guys launched this product in Christmas of 2009, and it was a pretty successful product launch. You had 25,000 orders and sounds like you're off to the races, but I guess even with this success, when you went out to raise money, this is 2010, were investors more excited or was it still a challenge to get more investors in?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> It was still a challenge. And at the time, it wasn't "Okay, I guess you guys are having some success, consumers are buyin the product, et cetera." And they congratulated us on that. But the were very scared of hardware businesses. I think there had been a lo of really high profile failures in the consumer electronics industry And so, it was very difficult for us to raise money. I remember, w had a spreadsheet of target VCs. I think there are 40 names that w put on that list. And literally, we went to number 40 before we wer able to raise money.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Raising money from VCs: 40 nos.</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And just giving the same pitch, again, again, answering the same questions?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Same pitch. We're in San Francisco driving down 101 to Sand Hill Road, constantly giving the same pitch to 40 VCs. That's probably the one thing I didn't like about that whole time period was, I hate giving the same pitch over and over and hearing the same questions and same objections, et cetera. That was not a fun or stimulating time for me.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Raising $8M (2010)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> All right. Eventually, the 40th investor does decide to give you some money. I think you raised about $8 million. And at this point, were you able to then have a proper office and a staff. Were you able to begin to recruit real full-time engineers and developers and people like that?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We were. We did that with the round that was right after our first $2 million institutional round. We hired a bunch of customer support personnel. I interviewed and hired our first head of sales. I interviewed and hired someone to finally run all of our manufacturing and operations, which was still a job that I was doing. I was still issuing all the [POS] and managing the inventory. And I think we were really fortunate because the early management team that we hired in those days pretty much made it up to and passed our IPO, which I think rarely happens.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Building a community</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> It's so crazy to think about it now. But I think early on, with the Fitbit, the idea was to be part of a bigger community. Like the data from your activity would be available. You would just go to a site and you could see it and you could see everybody else's because the idea was, "We're all part of this together." But I think early on, some users were tracking sex. And when you started to hear about these things was your reaction like, "Oh my god, I never even thought about this being a privacy thing. I always thought that people would just want to share stuff."</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. This was still the early days of sharing things like that. And I found out about it because I saw this tweet about someone going, "Hey, if you do this Google search, you'll see," because Google was indexing all our public pages where people are logging things that people had made public. "You could find out all the sexual activities that people are logging on Fitbit." And I saw that, I'm like, "Oh my god, this is not good." That ended up being the first real PR crisis for the company. And it was happening over the 4th of July weekend. So I had to call an emergency board meeting. We had to scramble to delete all that stuff, turn everything private.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Because the default setting, initially, when you got to Fitbit was, it's not private, it's open. Because the idea was, it was going to be a big community of people trying to get fit.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. I mean, we made a lot of things private by default. We made sure that people's weight was private because we thought that would be sensitive, but we didn't think that people's activities, there wasn't any harm in doing that and we just didn't realize that people would start logging that.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And just to be clear, people who logged sexual activity, this was not a category that you offered up, it was just people were voluntarily deciding to just log that as one of their activities.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Well, it was a category, but it wasn't something that we had realized. We use this database from the government that was thousands of different activities that people would do.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Oh, I see. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And so, it was an option. We just didn't think people would with log that.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> You were just naive about that.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We were naive. We were like, "Okay, this is a government database of activities. It must be fine." That was quite a shock and a wake up call for us.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">$76M in revenue (2012)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Fitbit for the first couple of years was, a, still a clip. Mainly a clip. And then, I think really 2011, you released the first product, Christmas of 2009, you've got 2010. By 2011, just business exploded, 5X growth from 2011, 2012. You went from $15 million in revenue to $76 million in revenue. What was going on? Was it just this self-generating phenomenon? Were you surprised by it? Were you've investing in marketing? Was it just unearned media, just people reporting on it? What was going on?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I think, the primary reason is, because we had baked in this social element, this community element into it from the very beginning, it ended up being a very viral product. So one family member would get it, and to really realize the potential, the community aspect and the competitive aspect, you had to have someone else as well. So they'd either buy it for their spouse or their parents and they would start competing and then they'd buy it for their friends and they'd try to get their friends to buy the product.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So they could each see how many steps you were... Because I remember this, I remember this in NPR. People were wearing Fitbits and they were talking and there was, I think there was even, people were encouraged to get Fitbits.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Exactly. It was very driven by word of mouth. And this viral spread was a huge driver of our growth in those days.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Worrying about Competition (2013)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> I think by 2013, you had some competitors coming in. Nike was making one and Jawbone was making one. I mean, I remember going to the TED Conference in 2013 and getting a Jawbone in my gift bag. Were you worried about the competition at that point, or not really?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. At that time I think people were looking at the success and there was even a name, coined for the whole category, which is quantified self. "How do I use sensors, et cetera, to measure everything that I'm doing in my entire life?" And so that attracted a lot of competition that you said. And I'd have to say the competitive aspect was definitely worrying at the time, especially with Nike and Jawbone.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Because they're so huge.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> There are huge. I mean, Nike, obviously, it's a multi-billion dollar, multi-national company with a lot of media dollars. I remember when they announced the FuelBand, they had all these celebrity athletes at the announcement and we're like, "Oh god, that's insane."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> And yet, by 2014 you had 67% of the activity tracking marketplace. I mean, Fitbit was just totally dominating the marketplace. I mean, were you and Eric doing victory laps and high-fiving each other and thinking back to all those doubters? I mean, what was going on?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I think we were still pretty, I don't know if scared is the right word. I think, it's still very, very cautious. Nothing was guaranteed. There was a lot of competition that was emerging. We still had a lot of internal challenges in the business, scaling production, scaling the company, et cetera. Again, a lot of fires for us to be solving on a day-to-day basis. And I remember occasionally we'd always check in and say, "Hey, when do you think we'll know we're going to make it?" And we'd say, "I think we'll know in six months." And we kept saying that every six months. It was pretty much an ongoing thing, pretty much up to the IPO.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The IPO (2015)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> 2015 was a huge turning point for you in many ways. You go public, I think your market cap, I read a certain point, reached $10 billion. That year, 2015, the Apple Watch is released and they stopped selling Fitbit in their stores. At the time you were quoted saying, I'm not really worried about this because it's a huge market. It's a $200 billion market. The Apple Watch is just crammed with a bunch of stuff, or smartwatches are crowned with a bunch of stuff. And what we're doing as something simpler." Was that, what you were saying publicly, because I don't know, you be felt like you should be saying that or did you really think that was true that the Apple Watch wouldn't actually have much of an impact?</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Apple Watch (2015)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We were definitely concerned with Apple. I mean, this was the preeminent technology, and especially a hardware company at the time with an amazing brand. We had faced off Philips and Nike and Jawbone, which were in their rights, very big competitors, especially Nike. We did feel very strongly that our product had very clear advantages. It was a simpler product. If you looked at the Apple Watch, that was announced at that time, I think everyone will admit maybe even Apple, that it was a product that didn't quite know what it was supposed to be used for. With the launch of the first Apple Watch, I don't really think that that had an actual impact on the trajectory of the business. It wasn't the product that it would later become. And the industry wasn't where it would eventually evolve either.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> I mean, but eventually, the industry did change. I mean, Apple Watch got really popular. I think, by 2016, Fitbit's stock had dropped by 75% over the course of a year. I mean, you and Eric were running a publicly traded company and the stock was just tumbling. What did you think? I mean, I can't imagine that was pleasant for you.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Running a Public Company</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> No, it was definitely a stressful period. And you could argue, well, maybe we shouldn't even have been valued at 10 billion in the first place. And I think in a lot of times it's a question of perception. If we had never hit that 10 billion and we had steadily grown into the 2 billion, I think people's perceptions and just psychology about the whole situation would have been different than going to 10 and falling to two. And it was a very challenging period because as a private company, despite challenges, your valuation doesn't change very often. It only changes when you raise money, which could happen once a year, once every two years. So if you hit a bump in the road, your employees don't really feel it.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> We had a product recall where, if we had been a public company, our valuation would have plummeted immediately, but at the time we were private. So we just told the employees, "Hey, look, this is the challenge. It's pretty serious, but here are the steps that we're going to take to get through it." And everyone rallied together. But when you're being measured every day in real-time-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> By the stock price.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> ... By the stock price, you're not really given a lot of breathing room to try to fix things.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">On Critical Feedback</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Even though you were introducing new products, revenue was declining every year from the time you went public. And I read an article about something that you did in 2017. And I'm really just curious to get your take on it, because I actually think it's really courageous, but also probably super stressful and difficult, which is, you asked your employees to submit an evaluation of the company and of you. And then you sat in front of them to hear the results of this evaluation and it wasn't good. You even had some employees who wrote letters to the board asking that you be removed as CEO. I can't imagine that was easy for you to hear.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> I don't know if I've heard that particular feedback directly, but clearly the survey results were not great. I have jokingly think, probably used to hearing very critical feedback because of my parents. I don't think there was a moment where they're truly happy with anything that I did. I remember even when I took the SATs and I got my score back, it was a pretty good score, but my dad just honed in on clearly the areas that I had not done well. I don't think I have a huge ego. I mean, I do have an ego, I think it's human to have one, but my primary focus was, "How do I get things back on track?"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> You had, there was a quote from somebody in an article. I was an anonymous quote. It said, "At a certain point, we're focused o the right things. We had the ability, and have the ability to know  lot about our users, which you do, but our users don't want to be tol what they did." In other words, they don't want to be told, "Hey, yo exercise, you did 10 steps today." They want to be told what to do Like how to get better. And the quote was, "This was the greates missed opportunity." And I know you've made a pivot since then, bu was that a fair assessment at the time in 2017, that you were to focused on telling people what they've accomplished rather tha telling them what they need to do?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. I think there are ultimately two big things that were driving the headwinds in the business. First of all, I think we were really behind in launching a competitive smartwatch at the time. People were-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Competitive to...</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Competitive to Apple. It was clear that the industry, consumers were moving to that category and we were seeing that in our sales. So in a very short period of time, our tracker business fell by $800 million in revenue. And at the time, at our peak, we were doing about 2.1 billion in revenue.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> So we had $800 million hole, and we finally launched our smartwatch, but it was only sufficient to fill that hole very barely. We hadn't transformed the software into giving people guidance and advice. And it also ties to our failure at the time to quickly diversify our revenue stream beyond just hardware to a services business that-</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Like a subscription.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Subscription Service</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Exactly. We were so focused on growing our hardware business because that was what was bringing in the money, that was what the retailers wanted, et cetera. And one of the mistakes I made was not setting up enough time, enough focus to building the subscription part of the business that actually answered those pivotal questions for our users.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> As many, many companies find themselves in a successful companies that have a successful legacy product, this is crazy talking, but a legacy product for your company, which is only 10 years old or 12 years old. You could argue that the Fitbit product is your legacy product, right? And that, as any company with a legacy product realizes, they've got to make a pivot. Like for American Express, it was traveller's checks for 100 years. That's how they made their money. And they had to pivot into other things, there is travel services and credit cards and so on. It sounds like in 2019, you really made a pivot into thinking about Fitbit, not as a hardware company that makes a tracker, watch, or device, like smartwatch, but a company that really is about healthcare and is designed to pivot more into healthcare data and analysis. Is that fair? Is that right?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah. I think that's fair. I think we stopped thinking of ourselves as a device company and more of as a behavior change company because that's effectively what people were buying our products and services to do, was to change their behavior in a really positive way. And not only individual people, but companies as well. Companies who in the US, especially bear the direct costs of the care of their employees. We started thinking about ourselves as a behavior change company and figuring out what are the products and services that really deliver that both to people and to businesses.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Google Acquisition (2019)</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> So we get to the end of last year where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/google-is-acquiring-fitbit/">Google announces that they were going to buy Fitbit, $2.1 billion</a>. We should mention that, at the time of this recording, it hasn't closed yet. To me, it makes perfect sense. If I'm you or Eric, I would have done it. I would've said, "$2.1 billion, that's great. That's a great outcome because now with Google, we've got access to their dollars and their research labs and all the people who work there and the analytics and our ability to really go to the next level." Why did it make sense from your perspective to sell to Google?</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah, that's a very complicated and emotionally fraught question, but last year our board met and it was pretty clear to everybody that we had a lot of challenges in the business. We weren't profitable. There was a lot of competition out there from the likes of Apple, from Samsung, some emerging Chinese competitors, but there was a lot of just great things going on in the company. I was so excited about our product roadmap, about things that were in our pipeline, all the advanced research that we were doing around health and sensors. I would look at our product roadmap every day and just come away super excited about that. And then also be confronted with a lot of the business challenges as well.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> And for me, most importantly it was about a legacy and I wanted the Fitbit brand and what we did to continue onwards for a very, very long time. And we just had to figure out the best way to do it, whether it was as an independent company or within a larger company. That was really what was most important.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> I imagine that there are some details you can't talk about for obvious reasons, but as of this recording, we're talking in mid-April, there is a hold on the Google acquisition. The department of justice is doing an investigation because there's some interest groups who have said, "Hey, we don't think that Google should have access to all of this data. That Fitbit has 28 million users. This is incredible trove of health data." Is that causing you stress right now that there is this justice department holdup on the acquisition?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> No. And it's because sometimes the press does like to sensationalize things, but the process that we're undergoing right now with the department of justice and also with the EU and some other countries around the world is pretty normal for acquisitions of the size. In fact, it's required. Really, the whole reviews about the anti-competitive element, and especially around the wearable market share. That's just something that we have to convince regulators that, "This doesn't reduce competition in the marketplace."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> As far as you know, the situation now with the lockdowns and the pandemic does not have any impact on Google's interest or commitment to making this happen.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> No, I think everyone's thinking towards the long-term, fingers crossed is that we do find ourselves through this COVID-19 situation and that there is life beyond that. Maybe it comes back slowly, but I think everyone is thinking, "What does this whole category look like in time span of years? How?" And I think what, one of the things that COVID-19 has shown is that, especially if you look at healthcare, this idea of remote health care, remote monitoring, people healthy outside of a hospital setting is actually really important.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> Super. It's going to totally change... I've had a video call with my doctor just for a quick question. It's actually super convenient.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Future of Medicine</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Exactly. And if during these telemedicine visits, if they have a snapshot in summary of what you've been up to and what your health has been outside of that visit, and almost be predictive in that way, I mean, I think that can be really groundbreaking in the way medicine gets practiced. And this whole time period is merely accelerating that transition.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> When you think about all of the things that you have done professionally and your successes, you made a lot of money. I mean, you're extremely wealthy and wealthier than your parents could have ever imagined you would be, or they would be. They took a huge risk to come to the US and had all these little mom-and-pop stores. How much of that do you think is because of your intelligence and skill and how much do you attribute to luck?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Closing thoughts</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>James:</strong> Yeah, that's always a tricky question to answer. I think, very fortunate to have grown up with my parents. Just having seen them persevere through life, you get the realization that nothing really comes easy. That it does take a lot of just grinding away at things that at the time seem unpleasant. I think those are good traits and very fortunate to have parents like that who sacrificed a lot to put me in great schools over time, even though they started from some humble beginnings. But also, have learned a lot of ways, gotten some lucky breaks where things could have gone the wrong way very, very quickly. Ultimately, I attribute it to a little bit of all of that. I think it's not fair to say that everything is luck because then I think you start to discount the actual things, actions that you can take on your own to affect the future. And that's really important.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Guy:</strong> That's James Park, co-founder of Fitbit. And here's a number for you, 34,642,772, that is how many steps James has tracked since he first put on that balsa wood Fitbit prototype. At least as of this recording. It's about 15,430 miles or 24,832 kilometers. And thanks so much for listening to the show this week, you can subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="insist-on-focus.html">"Insist on Focus" - Keith Rabois describes working at PayPal</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 28, 2021 — </span>I read an interesting Twitter thread on <a href="https://twitter.com/markkofman/status/1366030683118833665">focus strategy</a>. That led me to the 3-minute YouTube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcohHIJr6Ns">Insist on Focus</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Rabois">Keith Rabois</a>. I created the transcript below.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">One of the fundamental lessons I learned from Peter Thiel at PayPal was the value of focus. Peter had this somewhat absurd, but classically Peter way of insisting on focus, which is that he would only allow every employee to work on one thing and every executive to speak about one thing at a time, and he distributed this focus throughout the entire organization. So everybody was assigned exactly one thing, and that was the only thing you were allowed to work on, the only thing you were allowed to report back to him about.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">My top initiatives shifted around over the years, but I'll give you a few. One was initially Visa, MasterCard really hated us. We were operating at the edge of their rules at the time. My number one problem was to stop MasterCard particularly, but Visa a bit from killing us. So until I had that risk taken off the table, Peter didn't want to hear about any of my other ideas.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Once we put Visa, MasterCard into a pretty stable place than eBay also wanted to kill us. Wasn't very happy with us processing 70% of the payments on their platform, so that was my next problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Then 9/11 happened and the US Treasury Department promulgated regulations, which would require us among other things to collect Social Security numbers from all of our buyers, which would have suppressed our payment volumes substantially. So then my number one initiative became convincing the treasury department to not propagate these regulations, right post 9/11.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">At some point, we also needed to diversify our revenue off of eBay. So that became another initiative for me. That one I did not solve that well, which in some way led to us eventually agreeing to be acquired.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">I had another number one problem, which was this publication called the Red Herring, had published this set of unflattering articles about us and how to fix that and rebuild the communications team.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Peter would constantly just assign me new things. He didn't like the terms of our financial services relationship with the vendors that we were using, so I took on that team and fixed the economics of those relationships, et cetera, et cetera, but they were not done in parallel. They're basically sequential. The reason why this was such a successful strategy is that most people, perhaps all people tend to substitute from A-plus problems that are very difficult to solve, to be a plus problems, which you know a solution to, or you understand the path to solve.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">You have a checklist every morning. Imagine waking up, and a lot of people write checklists and things to accomplish. Most people have an A-plus problem, but they don't know the solution so they procrastinate on that solution? And then they go down the checklist to the second or third initiative where they know the answer and they'll go solve those problems and cross them off. The problem is if your entire organization is always solving the second, third or fourth most important thing, you never solve the first.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">So Peter's technique of forcing people to only work on one thing meant everybody had to work on the A-plus problems. And if every part of the organization once in a while can solve a problem that the rest of the world thinks is impossible, you wind up with an iconic company that the world's never seen before.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I absolutely love the math behind this strategy. There are a few other terms to get right, but there's a fantastic idea here.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 22, 2021 — </span>Today I'm launching the beta of something new called <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll">Scroll</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've been reading the newspaper everyday since I was a kid. I remember I'd have my feet on the ground, my body tilted at an angle and my body weight pressed into the pages on the counter. I remember staring intently at the pages spread out before me. World news, local news, sports, business, comics. I remember the smell of the print. The feel of the pages. The ink that would be smeared on my forearms when I finished reading and stood back up straight. Scroll has none of that. But it does at least have the same big single page layout.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Scroll brings back <em>some</em> of the magic of newspapers.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In addition to the layout, Scroll has two important differences from existing static publishing software.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First, Scroll is built for public domain sites and <em>only</em> public domain sites. Builders of Scroll will spend 100% of the time building for the amazing creators who understand and value the public domain.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Second, Scroll is a <a href="https://treenotation.org">Tree Language</a>. Unlike Markdown, Scroll is easily extensible. We can create and combine thousands of new sub languages to help people be more creative and communicate more effectively.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've had fun building Scroll so far and am excited to start working on it with others.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="tree-notation-annual-report-2019.html">2019 Tree Notation Annual Report</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 9, 2020 — </span><em>Note: I wrote this early draft in February 2020, but COVID-19 happened and somehow 11 months went by before I found this draft again. I am publishing it now as it was then, without adding the visuals I had planned but never got to, or making any major edits. This way it will be very easy to have next year's report be the best one yet, which will also include exciting developments in things like non-linear parsing and "forests".</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In 2017 I wrote a <a href="show-hn-programming-is-now-two-dimensional.html">post</a> about a half-baked idea I named <a href="https://treenotation.org">TreeNotation</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Since then, thanks to the help of a lot of people who have provided feedback, criticism and guidance, a lot of progress has been made flushing out the idea. I thought it might be helpful to provide an annual report on the status of the research until, as I stated in my earlier post, I "have data definitively showing that Tree Notation is useful, or alternatively, to explain why it is suboptimal and why we need more complex syntax."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My template for this (and maybe future) reports will be as follows:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >1. High level status</li>
<li >2. Restate the problem</li>
<li >3. 2019 Pros</li>
<li >4. 2019 Cons</li>
<li >5. Next Steps</li>
<li >6. Status of Predictions</li>
<li >7. Organization Status</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">High Level Status</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've followed the "Strong Opinions, Weakly Held" philosophy with this idea. I came out with a very strong claim: there is some natural and universal syntax that we could use for all of our symbolic languages that would be very useful—it would let us remove a lot of unnecessary complexity, allow us to focus more on semantics alone, and reap a lot of benefits by exploiting isomorphisms and network effects across domains. I've then spent a lot of time trying to destroy that claim.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After publishing my work I was expecting one of two outcomes. Most likely was that someone far smarter than I would put the nail in Tree Notation's coffin with a compelling case for why a such a universal notation is impossible or disadvantageous. My more optimistic—but less probable—outcome was that I would accumulate enough evidence through research and building to make a convincing case that a simplest universal notation is possible and highly advantageous (and it would be cool if Tree Notation evolves into that notation, but I'd be happy for any notation that solves the problem).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Unfortunately neither of those has happened yet. No one has convinced me that this is a dead-end idea and I haven't seen enough evidence that is a good idea<a href="#note-research">^</a>. At times it has seemed like a killer application of the notation was just around the corner that would demonstrate the advantages of this pattern, but while the technology has improved a lot, I can't say anything has turned out to be so compelling that I am certain of the idea.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So the high level status remains: strong opinion, weakly held. I am sticking to my big claim and still awaiting/working on proof or refutation.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Restating the Problem</h1>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What is the idea?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In these reports I'll try and restate the idea in a fresh way, but you can also find the idea explained in different places via <a href="https://treenotation.org/">visuals</a>, an <a href="https://faq.treenotation.org/">FAQ</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/treenotation/faq.treenotation.org/blob/master/spec.txt">spec</a>, <a href="https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/">demos</a>, etc.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My hypothesis is that there exists a <strong>Simplest Universal Notation for Symbolic Abstraction (SUNSA)</strong>. I propose Tree Notation as a potential candidate for that notation. It is hard to assign probabilities to events that haven't happened before, but I would say I am between 1% and 10% confident that a SUNSA exists and that Tree Notation is somewhat close to it<a href="#note-risk">^</a>. If Tree Notation is not the SUNSA, it at least gives me an angle of attack on the general problem.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's define a notation as a set of physical rules that can be used to represent abstractions. By simplest universal notation I mean the notation that can represent any and every abstraction representable by other notations that also has the smallest set of rules.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You could say there exists many "UNSAs", or Universal Notations for Symbolic Abstractions. For example, thousands of domain specific languages are built on the XML and JSON notations, but my hypothesis is that there is a single SUNSA. XML is not the SUNSA, because an XML document like <code>&lt;a>b&lt;/a></code> can be equivalently represented as <code>a b</code> using a notation with a smaller set of rules.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Where would a SUNSA fit?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Inventions aren't always built in a linear fashion. For example, when you add <code>2+3</code> on your computer, your machine will break down that statement into a binary form and compute something like <code>0010</code> + <code>0011</code>. The higher level base 10 are converted into the lower level base 2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary numbers</a>. So, before your computer solves <code>2+3</code>, it must do the equivalent of <code>import binary</code>. But we had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> centuries before we had boolean numerals. Dependencies can be built out of order.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Similarly, I think there is another missing dependency that fits somewhere between binary the idea and <code>binary</code> the symbolic word.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid's_Elements">Euclid's Elements</a>, maybe the most famous math book of all time written around 2,500 years ago. The book begins with the title "Στοιχεῖα"<a href="#note-euclid">^</a>. Already there is a problem: where is <code>import the letter Σ</code>?. Euclid has imported undefined abstractions: letters and a word. Now, if we were to digitally encode the Elements today from scratch, we would first include the binary dependency and then a character encoding dependency like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>. We abstract first from binary to symbols. Then maybe once we have things in a text stream, we might abstract again to encode the Elements book into something like XML and markdown. I think there is a missing notation in both of these abstractions: the abstraction leap from binary to characters, and abstraction leap from characters to words and beyond.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think to represent the jumps from binary to symbols to systems, there is a best natural notation. A SUNSA that fits in between languages that let's us build mountains of abstraction without introducing extra syntax.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">To get a little more concrete, let me show a rough approximation of how using Tree Notation you could imagine a document that starts with just the concept of a bit (here denoted on line 2 as ".") and work your way up to defining digits and characters and words and entities. There is a lot of hand-waving going on here, which is why Tree Notation is still, at best, a half-baked idea.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why would a SUNSA be advantageous?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Given that I still consider this idea half-baked at best; given that I don't have compelling evidence that this notation is worthwhile; given that no one else has built a killer app using the idea (even though I've collaborated publically and privately with many dozens of people on project ideas at this point); why does this idea still excite me so much?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The reason is because I think IF we had a SUNSA, there would be tremendous benefits and applications. I'll throw out three potential application domains that I personally find very interesting.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Idea #1: Mapping the Frontiers of Symbolic Science</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A SUNSA would greatly <em>reduce the cost</em> of a common knowledge base of science. While it may be possible to do it today without a SUNSA, having one would be at least a one order of magnitude cost reduction. Additionally, if there is not a SUNSA, than it may take just as long to come to agreement on what UNSA to use for a common knowledge base of science as it would to actual build the base!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By encoding all of science into a universal syntax, in addition to tremendous pedagogical benefits, we could take analogies like this:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="phd.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="phd.png" width="259" height="194" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And make them actual concrete visualizations.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Idea #2: Law (and Taxes)</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This one always gets me excited. I believe there is a deep connection between simplicity, justice, and fairness. I believe legal systems with unnecessary complexity are unfair, prima facie. While legal systems will always be human-made, rich in depth, nuanced, and evolving, we could shed the noise. I dream of a world where paychecks, receipts, and taxes are all written in the same language; where medical records can be cut and pasted; and where when I want to start a business I don't have to fill out forms in Delaware (the codesmell in that last one is so obvious!).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I believe a SUNSA would give us a way to measure complexity as neatly as we measure distance, and allow us to simplify laws to their signal, so that they serve all people, and we don't suffer from all that noise and inefficiency.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Idea #3: Showcasing the Common Patterns in Computing From Low Level to High Level</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I love projects like <a href="https://godbolt.org">godbolt.org</a>, that let you jump up and down all the levels of abstraction in computing. I think there's an opportunity to do some incredible things if there is a SUNSA and the patterns in languages at different layers of computing all looked roughly the same (since they <em>are</em> roughly the same!).</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What would the properties of a SUNSA be?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Tree Notation might not be the SUNSA, but it has a few properties that I think a SUNSA would have.</p>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li >2 or more physical dimensions: Every symbolic abstraction would have to be contained in the SUNSA, so to include an abstraction like the letter "a" would require a medium have at least more than one physical dimension.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="2."><li >Directional: A SUNSA would not just define how symbols are laid out, but it would also contain concepts of directionality.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="3."><li >Scopes: Essential for growth and collaboration.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="4."><li >Brevity: I think a SUNSA will have fewer components, not more. I often see new replacements for S-Expressions or JSON come out with more concepts, not less. I don't think this is the way to go—I think a SUNSA will be like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness">NAND gate</a> and not a suite of gates, although the latter are handy and pragmatic.</li></ol>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I also will list one thing I don't think a SUNSA will have:</p>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li >A single entry point. Currently most documents and programs are parsed with a start to finish in a linear order. With Tree Notation you can parse things in any order you want—start from anywhere, move in any direction, or even start in multiple places at the same time. I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip">this</a> will be a property of a SUNSA. Maybe SUNSA programs will look more like this than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code#/media/File:CodeCmmt002.svg">that</a>.</li></ol>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So those are a few things that I think we'll find in a SUNSA. Will we ever find a SUNSA?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why might there not be a SUNSA?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think a really good piece of evidence that we don't need a SUNSA is that we've seen <strong>STUPENDOUS SUCCESS WITH THOUSANDS OF SYNTAXES</strong>. The pace of progress in computing in the 1900's and 2000's has been tremendous, perhaps <strong>because</strong> of the Smörgåsbord of notations.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Who's to say that a SUNSA is needed? I guess my retort to that, is that although we do indeed have thousands of digital notations and languages, all of them, without exception, compile down to binary, so clearly having some low level universal notation has proved incredibly advantageous so far.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">2019 Pros</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So that concludes my restatement of the Tree Notation idea in terms of a more generic SUNSA concept. Now let me continue on and mention briefly some developments in 2019.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here I'll just write some bullet points of work done this past ~ year advancing the idea.</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Types and Cells</li>
<li >Tree Notation as a Subset of Grid Notation</li>
<li >New homepage</li>
<li >TreeBase</li>
<li >CopyPaster</li>
<li >Dozens of new Tree Languages</li>
<li >More feedback than ever. Tens of thousands of visitors. Hundreds of conversations.</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">2019 Cons</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here I just list some marks against this idea.</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >It still sucks.</li>
<li >No killer app yet.</li>
<li >No good General Purpose Tree Language.</li>
<li >No good Assembly Tree Language.</li>
<li >No good LISP Tree Language.</li>
<li >No good LLVM IR tie in yet.</li>
<li >One argument put to me: "there's no need for a universal syntax with deep learning—complexity IS the universal syntax."</li>
<li >Another argument put to me: "sure it is still simple BUT there are 2 types of inventions: ones that get more complex over time and ones that no one uses"</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Next Steps</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Next steps is more of the same. Keep attempting to solve problems by simplifying the encoding of them to their essence (which happens to be Tree Notation, according to the theory). Build tools ot make that easier and leverage those encodings. This year LSP will likely be a focus, Grid Notation, and the PLDB.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Tree Notation has a secret weapon: Simplicity does not go out of style. Slippers today look just like slippers in Egypt 3,000 years ago</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Status of Predictions in Paper</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My Tree Notation <a href="https://github.com/treenotation/research/blob/master/papers/paper/treenotation.pdf">paper</a> was my first ever attempt at writing a scientific paper and my understanding was that a good theory would make some refutable predictions. Here are the predictions I made in that paper and where they stand today.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Prediction 1: no structure will be found that cannot serialize to TN.</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">While this prediction has held, a number of people have commented that it doesn't predict much, as the same could really be said about most languages. Anything you can represent in Tree Notation you can represent in many encodings like XML.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What I should have predicted is something along the lines of this: <em>Tree Notation is the smallest set of syntax rules that can represent all abstractions</em>. I think trying to formalize a prediction along those lines would be a worthwhile endeavor (possibly for the reason that in trying to do what I just said, I may learn that what I just said doesn't make sense).</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Prediction 2: TLs will be found for every popular 1DL.</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This one has not come true yet. While I have made many public <a href="https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/">Tree Languages</a> myself and many more private ones, and I have prototyped many with other people, the net utility of Tree Languages is not high enough that people are rushing to design these things. Many people have kicked the tires, but things are not good enough and there is a lack of demand.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">On the supply side, it has turned out to be a bit harder to design useful Tree Languages than I expected. Not by 100x, but maybe by as much as 10x. I learned a lot of bad design patterns not to put in Tree Languages. I learned that bad tooling will force compromises in language design. For example, before I had syntax highlighting I relied on wierd punctation like "@" vs "#" prefixes for distinguishing types. I also learned a lot of patterns that seem to be useful in Tree Languages (like word suffixes for types). I learned good tooling leads to simpler and better languges.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Prediction 3: Tree Oriented Programming (TOP) will supersede Object Oriented Programming.</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This one has not come true yet. While there is a tremendous amount of what I would call "Tree Oriented Programming" going on, programmers are still talking about objects and message passing and are not viewing the world as trees.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Prediction 4: The simplest 2D text encodings for neural networks will be TLs.</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This one is a fun one. Definitely has not come true yet. But I've got a new attack vector to try and potentially crack it.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Status of Long Bet</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After someone suggested it, I made a <a href="http://longbets.org/793/">Long Bet</a> predicting the rise of Tree Notation or a SUNSA within ten years of my initial Tree Notation post. Clearly I am far off from winning this bet at this point, as there are not any candidate languages even noted in TIOBE, never mind in the Top 10. However, IF I were to win the bet, I'd expect it wouldn't be until around 2025 that we'd see any candidate languages even appear on TIOBE's radar. In other words, absense of evidence is not evidence of absense.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">As an aside, I really like the idea of Long Bet, and I'm hoping it may prompt someone to come up with a theoretical argument against a SUNSA that buries my ideas for good. Now, it would be very easy to take the opposing side of my bet with the simple argument that the idea of 7/10 TIOBE languages dropping by 2027 won't happen because such a shift has never happened so quickly. However, I'd probably reject that kind of challenge as non-constructive, unless it was accompanied by something like a detailed data-backed case with models showing potential speed limits on the adoption of any language (which would be a constructive contribution).</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Organization Status</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In 2019 I explored the idea of putting together a proper research group and a more formal organization around the idea.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I put the breaks on that for three reasons. The first is I just don't have a particularly keen interest in building an organization. I love to be <em>part of a team</em>, but I like to be more hands on with the ideas and the work of the team rather than the meta aspect. I've gotten great help for this project at an informal level, so there's no rush to formalize it. The second reason is I don't have a great aptitude for team building, and I'm not ready yet to dedicate the time to that. I get excited by ideas and am good at quickly explore new idea spaces, but being the captain who calmly guides the ship toward a known destination just isn't me right now. The third reason is just the idea remains too risky and ill-defined. If it's a good idea, growth will happen eventually, and there's no need to force it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There is a loose confederation of folks I work on this idea with, but no formal organization with an office so far.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Conclusion</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That's it for the recap of 2019! Tune in next year for a recap of 2020.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>
</div></div>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li ><a name="note-research"></a>Regardless of whether or not Tree Notation turns out to be a good idea, as one part of the effort to prove/disprove it I've built a lot of big datasets on languages and notations, which seem to be useful for other people. Credit for that is due to a number of people who advised me back in 2017 to "learn to research properly".</li>
<li ><a name="note-risk"></a> Note that this means I am between 90-99% confident that Tree Notation is <em>not</em> a good idea. However, if it's a bad idea I am 40% confident the attempt to prove it a bad idea will have positive second-order effects. I am 50% confident that it will turn out I should have dropped this idea years ago, and it's a crackpot or Dunning–Kruger theory, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't recognize that as a highly probably scenario that has kept me up some nights.</li>
<li ><a name="note-euclid"></a> When it was first coming together, it wasn't a "book" as we think of books today and authorship is very fuzzy, but that doesn't affect things for my purposes here.</li></ul><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="medical-records-to-the-moon.html">Medical Records to the Moon</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 2, 2020 — </span>A paradigm change is coming to medical records. In this post I do some back-of-the-envelope math to explore the changes ahead, both qualitative and quantitative. I also attempt to answer the question no one is asking: <strong>in the future will someone's medical record stretch to the moon?</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Medical Records at the Provider</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Medical records are generally stored with healthcare providers and currently at least <a href="https://dashboard.healthit.gov/apps/health-information-technology-data-summaries.php?state=National&cat9=all+data&cat1=ehr+adoption#summary-data">86%-96%</a> of providers use an EHR system.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Americans visit their healthcare providers an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/physician-visits.htm">average of 4 times per year</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you were to plot the cumulative medical data storage use for the average American patient, it would look something like the abstract chart below, going up in small increments during each visit to the doctor:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="medicalRecords/providers.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="medicalRecords/providers.png" width="698" height="281" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A decade ago, this chart would not only show the quantity of a patient's medical data stored at their providers, but also the quantity of <em>all</em> of the patient's medical data. Simply put: people did not generally keep their own medical records. But this has changed.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Medical Records at Home</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now people own wearables like FitBits and Apple Watches. People use do-it-yourself services like 23andMe and uBiome. And in the not-too-distant future, the trend of ever-miniaturizing <a href="https://nanoporetech.com/products">lab devices</a> will enable advanced protocols at home. So now we have an additional line, reflecting the quantity of the patient's medical data from their own devices and services:</p>
</div></div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="medicalRecords/devices.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="medicalRecords/devices.png" width="692" height="285" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you put the two together you can see the issue:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="medicalRecords/both.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="medicalRecords/both.png" width="702" height="281" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Patients will log <em>far</em> more medical data on their own than they do at their providers'.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Implication #1: Change in Ownership</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It seems highly likely then that the possession of medical records will flip from providers to patients. I now have 120 million heart rate readings from my own devices, while I might have a few dozen from my providers. The gravity of the former will be harder and harder to overcome.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Patients won't <em>literally</em> be in possession of their records. While some nerdy patients—the kind of people who host their own email servers—might host their own open records, most will probably use a service provider. Prior attempts at creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_health_record">personal health record systems</a>, including some from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_HealthVault">biggest</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Health">companies</a> around, did not catch on. But back then we didn't have the exponential increase in personal medical data, and the data gravity that creates, that we have today.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm noticing a <a href="https://www.khealth.ai/">number</a> of <a href="https://www.humanapi.co/">startups</a> innovating along this wave (and if you know of other exciting ones, please share!). However, it seems that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_(Apple)">Apple Health</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitbit">FitBit</a> are in strong positions to emerge as leading providers of PHR as-a-service due to data gravity.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Implication #2: Change in Design</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Currently EHR providers like <a href="https://www.epic.com/">Epic</a> design and sell their products for providers first. If patients start making the decisions about which PHR tool to use, product designers will have to consider the patient experience first.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think this extends beyond products to standards. While there are some <a href="https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/">great</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Healthcare_Interoperability_Resources">groups</a> working on open standards for medical records, none, as far as I'm aware, consider patients as a first class user of their grammars and definitions. I personally think that a standards system can be developed that is fully understandable by patients without compromising on the needs of experts.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">One simple UX innovation in medical records that I love is <a href="https://www.va.gov/bluebutton/">BlueButton</a> Developed by the V.A. in 2010, BlueButton allows patients to download their entire medical records as a single file. While the grammar and parse-ability of BlueButton leave much to be desired, I think the concept of "your entire medical history in a single document" is a very elegant design.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Implication #3: Change in Scale</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">As more and more different devices contribute to patients' medical documents, what will the documents look like and how big will they get? Will someone's medical records stretch to the moon?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think the BlueButton concept provides a helpful mental model here: you can visualize any person's medical record as a single document. Let's call this document an <em>MRD</em> for "Medical Record Document".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's imagine a 30 year old in 2050. They'd have around 11,200 days worth of data (I included some days for in utero records). Let's say there are 4 "buckets" of medical data in their MRD:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Time series sensor data</li>
<li >Image and point cloud data</li>
<li >Data from microbio protocols like genomic and metabolomic data</li>
<li >Text data</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This is my back of the envelope math of how many megabytes of data might be in each of those buckets:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="medicalRecords/categories.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="medicalRecords/categories.png" width="753" height="302" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I am assuming that sensor development advances <em>a lot</em> in 40 years. I am assuming our patient of the future has:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >1,000 different passive 1-D biomedical sensors recording a reading once per second</li>
<li >10 different passive photo and 3-D cameras capturing 100 frames per day each</li>
<li >100 passive microbio systems generating 1GB of data per protocol (don't ask me how these will work, maybe something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJklHwoYgBQ">this</a>)</li>
<li >For good measure I throw in a fourth bucket of 100k characters a day of plain text data</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By my estimate this person would log about <strong>100GB of medical data per day, or about 100 petabytes of data in 30 years</strong>. That would fit on roughly 1,000 of today's <a href="https://nimbusdata.com/products/exadrive-platform/scalable-ssds/">hard drives</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you printed this record in a single doc, on 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper, in a human readable form—i.e. print the text, print the time series data as line charts, print the images, and print various types of output for the various protocols—the printed version would be about <strong>138,000,000 pages</strong> which laid end-to-end would stretch <strong>24,000 miles</strong>. If you printed it double-sided and stacked it like a book it would be <strong>4.2 miles high</strong>.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="medicalRecords/moon.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="medicalRecords/moon.png" width="749" height="299" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>So for a 120 year old in 2140, their printed MRD would not reach the moon.</strong> Though it may make it halfway there.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 2, 2020 — </span>I expect the future of healthcare will be powered by consumer devices. Devices you wear. Devices you keep in your home. In the kitchen. In the bathroom. In the medicine cabinet.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">These devices record medical data. Lots of data. They record data from macro signals like heart rate, temperature, hydration, physical activity, oxygen levels, body temperature, brain waves, voice activity. They also record data from micro signals like antibodies, RNA expression levels, metabolomics, microbiome, etc.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Most of the data is collected passively and regularly. But sometimes your Health app prompts you to take out the digital otoscope or digital stethoscope to examine an unusual condition more closely.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This data is not stored in a network at the hospital you don't have access to. Instead you can access all of that data as easily as you can access your email. You can see that data on your wrist, on your phone, on your tablet.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You can understand that data too. You can click and dive into the definitions of every term. You can see what is meant by macro concepts like "VO2 max" and micro concepts like "RBC Count" or "BRC1 expression". Everything is explained precisely and thoroughly. Not only in words but in interactive visualizations that are customized to your body. The algorithms and models that turn the raw signals into higher level concepts are constantly improving.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you get flu like symptoms, you don't alternate between anxiously Googling symptoms and scheduling doctor's appointments. Instead, your Health app alerts you that your signals have changed, it diagnoses your condition, shows you how your patterns compare to tens of thousands of people who have experienced similar changes, and makes recommendations about what to do next. You can even see forecasts of how your condition will change in the days ahead, and you can simulate how different treatment strategies might affect those outcomes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You can not only reduce illness, but you can improve well-being too. You can see how your physical habits, social habits, eating habits, sleeping habits, correlate with hundreds of health and other signals.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The best part of all of this? Healthcare powered by consumer devices seems like it will be a lot cheaper.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Concentric Circles</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">An interesting pattern that I never saw before is how the five waves above are roughly arranged in circles. The oldest symbols (letters) are close to the center, followed by the Hindu-Arabic Numbers, surrounded by the punctuation of the Englightenment, surrounded by the keys of the keyboard, surrounded by the recent additions in the P.C. era. Again, painting with broad strokes, but I found that to be an interesting pattern.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">I got this idea last week and couldn't get it out of my head. Yesterday I took a quick crack at it. I didn't have much time to spare, just enough to explore the big ideas.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I started by typing all the characters on my keyboard into a Tree Notation document. Then I dug up some years for a handful of the symbols.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Next I found the great Apple CSS keyboard. I stitched together the two and it seemed to be at least mildly interesting so I opted to continue.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I then flushed out most of the dataset.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Finally I played around with a number of visualization effects. At first I thought heatmaps would work well, and tried a few variations on that, but wasn't happy with anything. I posted my work-in-progress to a few friends last night and called it a day. Today I switched to the "disappearing keys" visualization. That definitely felt like a better approach than the heatmap.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="an-unpopular-phrase.html">An Unpopular Phrase</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 21, 2020 — </span>One of the most <em>un</em>popular phrases I use is the phrase "Intellectual Slavery Laws".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think perhaps the best term for copyright and patent laws is "Intellectual Monopoly Laws". When called by that name, it is obvious that there should be careful scrutiny of these kinds of laws.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">However, the industry insists on using the false term "Intellectual Property Laws."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Instead of wasting my breath trying to pull them away from the property analogy, lately I've leaned into it and completed the analogy for them. So let me explain "Intellectual Slavery Laws".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">As far as I can figure, you cannot have Property Rights and "Intellectual Property" rights. Having both is logically inconsistent. My computer is my property. However, by law there are billions of peaceful things I cannot do on my computer. Therefore, my computer is not my property.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Unless of course, the argument is that my computer is my property, but some copyright and patent holders have property rights over <em>me</em>, so their property rights allow them to restrict my freedom. I still get rights over my property. But other people get rights over me. Property Rights and Intellectual Slavery Laws can logically co-exist! Logical inconsistency solved!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We can have a logical debate about whether we should have an Intellectual Slavery System, Intellectual Slavery Laws, Intellectual Slavery Law Schools, Intellectual Slavery Lawyers, etc. But we cannot have a <em>logical</em> debate about Intellectual Property Laws. Because the term itself is not logical.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I know, having now used this term with a hundred different people, that this is a not a popular thing to say. But I think someone needs to say it. Do we really think we are going to be an interplanetary species and solve the world's biggest challenges if we keep 99+% of the population in intellectual chains?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Errata</h1>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >"They are stealing my IP." What would your "IP" be if you weren't "stealing" inventions like words, the alphabet, numbers, rules of physics, etc, that were developed and passed down over thousands of years?</li>
<li >"But shouldn't creators be paid for their work?" Yes. Pay them upon delivery. No need for monopolies. Does a janitor, after cleaning a room, get to charge everyone who enters a royalty for 100 years?</li>
<li >"Not a big deal—rights expire after a certain time." The fact that Copyrights and Patents expire on an arbitrary date is more proof that these should not be called property rights.</li>
<li >"This is not an urgent problem." I think Intellectual Slavery Laws have deep, direct connections to major problems of our time including healthcare, education, and inequality problems.</li>
<li >"This is anti-capitalist." This is pro-property rights.</li>
<li >"What about trademarks?" Centralized naming registries like Trademarks are fine, as long as anyone can start a registry. Posing as someone else isn't an IP violation, it is fraud. Already consequences for that. </li>
<li >"If you think the U.S. is bad, go visit China." I acknowledge that we have tremendous intellectual freedoms in the U.S., especially compared to other countries. I don't take freedom of speech and freedom of press for granted. However, I believe we are capping ourselves greatly by not legalizing full intellectual freedom.</li>
<li >"This is offensive to people suffering from physical slavery or its lingering effects." The people who would benefit the most from abolishing Intellectual Slavery laws are the same people who have suffered the most from physical slavery systems.</li>
<li >"I am an Intellectual Property lawyer and this offends me." The phrase "Intellectual Property" offends me.</li>
<li >"What about Trade Secrets?" Trade secrets and private information are fine. No one should be forced to publish anything. But once you publish something, let it thrive.</li>
<li >"Can't we just copyleft our way to the promised land?" Perhaps, but why lie about the system in the meanwhile?</li>
<li >One difference between Physical Slavery and Intellectual Slavery is in the latter it is slavery from a million masters.</li>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="building-a-treebase-with-6.5-million-files.html">Building a TreeBase with 6.5 million files</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 29, 2020 — </span>In this long post I'm going to do a stupid thing and see what happens. Specifically I'm going to create 6.5 million files in a single folder and try to use Git and Sublime and other tools with that folder. All to explore this new thing I'm working on.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://truebase.pub">TreeBase</a> is a new system I am working on for long-term, strongly-typed collaborative knowledge bases. The design of TreeBase is dumb. It's just a folder with a bunch of files encoded with <a href="https://treenotation.org">Tree Notation</a>. A row in a normal SQL table in TreeBase is roughly equivalent to a file. The filenames serve as IDs. Instead of each using an optimized binary storage format it just uses plain text like UTF-8. Field names are stored alongside the values in every file. Instead of starting with a schema you can just start adding files and evolve your schema and types as you go.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For example, in this tiny demo <a href="https://github.com/breck7/truebase/tree/main/planetsDB">TreeBase of the planets</a> the file <code>mars.planet</code> looks like this:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">diameter 6794
surfaceGravity 4
yearsToOrbitSun 1.881
moons 2</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">TreeBase is composed of 3 key ingredients.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Ingredient 1: A folder</strong> All that TreeBase requires is a file system (although in theory you could build an analog TreeBase on paper). This means that you can use any tools on your system for editing files for editing your database.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Ingredient 2: Git</strong> Instead of having code to implement any sort of versioning or metadata tracking, you just use Git. Edit your files and use Git for history, branching, collaboration, etc. Because Tree Notation is a line and word based syntax it meshes really well with Git workflows.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Ingredient 3: <a href="https://treenotation.org">Tree Notation</a></strong> The Third Ingredient for making a TreeBase is Tree Notation. Both schemas and data use Tree Notation. This is a new very simple syntax for encoding strongly typed data. It's simple, extensible, and plays well with Git.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">TreeBase Compared to Other Database Systems</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Probably hundreds of billions of dollars has gone into designing robust database systems like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx">SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> and so forth. These things run the world. They are incredibly robust and battle-hardened. Everything that can happen is thought of and planned for, and everything that can go wrong has gone wrong (and learned from). These databases can handle trillions of rows, can conduct complex real-time transactions, and survive disasters of all sort. They use sophisticated binary formats and are tuned for specific file systems. Thousands of people have gotten their PhD's working on database technology.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">TreeBase doesn't have any of that. TreeBase is stupid. It's just a bunch of files in a folder.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You might be asking yourself "Why use TreeBase at all when great databases exist?". To further put the stupidity of the current TreeBase design into perspective, the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/bharry/the-largest-git-repo-on-the-planet/">Largest Git Repo on the Planet is Windows</a> which has 3.5 million files. I'm going to try and create a repo with 6.5 million files on my laptop.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Even if you think TreeBase is silly aren't you curious what happens when I try to put 6.5 million files into one folder? I kind of am. If you want an explanation of <em>why</em> TreeBase, I'll get to that near the end of this post.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But first...</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Let's Break TreeBase</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here again is a <a href="https://github.com/breck7/truebase/tree/main/planetsDB">demo TreeBase</a> with only 8 files.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The biggest TreeBase I work with has on the order of 10,000 files. Some files have thousands of lines, some just a handful.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">While TreeBase has been great at this small scale, a question I've been asked, and have wondered myself, is what happens when a TreeBase gets too big?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm about to find out, and I'll document the whole thing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Every time something bad happens I'll include a 💣.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Choosing a Topic</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">TreeBase is meant for knowledge bases. So all TreeBases center around a topic.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">To test TreeBase on a big scale I want something realistic. I wanted to choose some big structured database that thousands of people have contributed to that's been around for a while and see what it would look like as a TreeBase.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">IMDB is just such a database and amazingly makes a lot of their data available for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/">download</a>. So movies will be the topic and the IMDB dataset will be my test case.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Dataset</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First I grabbed the data. I downloaded the 7 files from IMDB to my laptop. After unzipping, they were about 7GB.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">One file, the 500MB <code>title.basics.tsv</code>, contained basic data for all the movie and shows in the database.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here's what that file looks like with <code>head -5 title.basics.tsv</code>:</p>
<table class="scrollTable"><thead><tr><th>tconst</th>

<p class="scrollParagraph">This looks like a good candidate for TreeBase. With this TSV I can create a file for each movie. I don't need the other 6 files for this experiment, though if this was a real project I'd like to merge in that data as well (in that case I'd probably create a second TreeBase for the <code>names</code> in the IMDB dataset).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Doing a simple line count <code>wc -l title.basics.tsv</code> I learn that there are around 6.5M titles in <code>title.basics.tsv</code>. With the current implementation of TreeBase this would be 6.5M files in 1 folder. That should handily break things.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The TreeBase design calls for me to create 1 file for every row in that TSV file. To again stress how dumb this design is keep in mind a 500MB TSV with 6.5M rows can be parsed and analyzed with tools like R or Python in seconds. You could even load the thing near instantly into a SQLite database and utilize any SQL tool to explore the dataset. Instead I am about to spend hours, perhaps days, turning it into a TreeBase.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">From 1 File to 6.5 Million Files</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What will happen when I split 1 file into 6.5 million files? Well, it's clear I am going to waste some space.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A file doesn't just take up space for its contents: it also has metadata. Every file contains metadata like permissions, modification time, etc. That metadata must take up some space, right? If I were to create 6.5M new files, how much extra space would that take up?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My MacBook uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a> It can hold up to 9,000,000,000,000,000,000 files. I can't easily find hard numbers on how much metadata one file takes up but can at least start with a ballpark estimate.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'll start by considering the space filenames will take up.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In TreeBase filenames are composed of a permalink and a file extension. The file extension is to make it easier for editors to understand the schema of a file. In the planets TreeBase above, the files all had the <code>planet</code> extension and there is a <code>planet.grammar</code> file that contains information for the tools like syntax highlighters and type checkers. For my new IMDB TreeBase there will be a similar <code>title.grammar</code> file and each file will have the ".title" extension. So that is 6 bytes per file. Or merely 36MB extra for the file extensions.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Next, the body of each filename will be a readable ID. TreeBase has meaningful filenames to work well with Git and existing file tools. It keeps things simple. For this TreeBase, I will make the ID from the primaryTitle column in the dataset. Let's see how much space that will take.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'll try <code>xsv select primaryTitle title.basics.tsv | wc</code>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 I got this error:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">CSV error: record 1102213 (line: 1102214, byte: 91470022): found record with 8 fields, but the previous record has 9 fields
 1102213 3564906 21815916</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv">XSV</a> didn't like something in that file. Instead of getting bogged down, I'll just work around it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'll build a subset from the first 1M rows with <code>head -n 1000000 title.basics.tsv > 1m.title.basics.tsv</code>. Now I will compute against that subset with <code>xsv select primaryTitle 1m.title.basics.tsv | wc</code>. I get <code>19751733</code> so an average of 20 characters per title.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'll combine that with the space for file extension and round that to say 30 extra bytes of file information for each of the 6.5 million titles. <strong>So about 200MB of extra data required to split this 500MB file into filenames. Even though that's a 50% increase, 200MB is dirt cheap so that doesn't seem so bad.</strong></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You may think that I could save a roughly equivalent amount by dropping the primaryTitle field. However, even though my filenames now contain information from the title, my permalink schema will generally distort the title so I need to preserve it in each file and won't get savings there. I use a more restrictive character set in the permalink schema than the file contents just to make things like URLs easier.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Again you might ask why not just an integer for the permalink? You could but that's not the TreeBase way. The human readable permalinks play nice with tools like text editors, URLs, and Git. TreeBase is about leveraging software that already works well with file systems. If you use meaningless IDs for filenames you do away with one of the very useful features of the TreeBase system.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I won't just waste space in metadata. I'm also going to add duplicate data to the contents of each file. That's because I won't be storing just values like <code>1999</code> but I'll also be repeating column names in each file like <code>startYear 1999</code>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How much space will this take up? The titles file has 9 columns and using <code>head -n 1 1m.title.basics.tsv | wc</code> I see that adds up to 92 bytes. I'll round that up to 100, and multiple by 6.5M, and that adds up to about 65,000,000 duplicate words and 650MB. In other words the space requirements roughly doubled (of course, assuming no compression by the file system under the hood).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You might be wondering why not just drop the column names from each file? Again, it's just not the TreeBase way. By including the column names, each file is self-documenting. I can open up any file with a text editor and easily change it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>So to recap: splitting this 1 TSV file into 6.5 million files is going to take up 2-3x more space due to metadata and repetition of column names.</strong></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Because this is text data, that's actually not so bad. I don't foresee problems arising from wasted disk space.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Foreseeing Speed Problems</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Before I get to the fun part, I'm going to stop for a second and try and predict what the problems are going to be.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Again, in this experiment I'm going to build and attempt to work with a TreeBase roughly 1,000 times larger than any I've worked with before. A 3 order of magnitude jump.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Disk space won't be a problem. But are the software tools I work with on a day-to-day basis designed to handle millions of files in a single folder? How will they hold up?</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li ><strong>Bash</strong> How will the basics like <code>ls</code> and <code>grep</code> hold up in a folder with 6.5M files?</li>
<li ><strong>Git</strong> How slow will <code>git status</code> be? What about <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>?</li>
<li ><strong>Sublime Text</strong> Will I even be able to open this folder in Sublime Text? Find/replace is something I so commonly use, will that work?  How about regex find/replace?</li>
<li ><strong>Finder</strong> Will I be able to visually browse around?</li>
<li ><strong>TreeBase Scripts</strong> Will my simple TreeBase scripts be usable? Will I be able to type check a TreeBase?</li>
<li ><strong>GitHub</strong> Will GitHub be able to handle 6.5M files?</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Proceeding in Stages</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Since I am going to make a 3 order of magnitude jump, I figured it would be best to make those jumps one at a time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Actually, to be smart, I will create 5 TreeBases and make 4 jumps. I'll make 1 small TreeBase for sanity checks and then four where I increase by 10x 3 times and see how things hold up.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First, I'll create 5 folders: <code>mkdir 60; mkdir 6k; mkdir 60k; mkdir 600k; mkdir 6m</code></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now I'll create 4 smaller subsets for the smaller bases. For the final 6.5M base I'll just use the original file.</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">head -n 60 title.basics.tsv > 60/titles.tsv
head -n 6000 title.basics.tsv > 6k/titles.tsv
head -n 60000 title.basics.tsv > 60k/titles.tsv
head -n 600000 title.basics.tsv > 600k/titles.tsv</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now I'll write a script to turn those TSV rows into TreeBase files.</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">#! /usr/local/bin/node --use_strict
const { jtree } = require("jtree")
const { Disk } = require("jtree/products/Disk.node.js")
const folder = "600k"
const path = `${__dirname}/../imdb/${folder}.titles.tsv`
const tree = jtree.TreeNode.fromTsv(Disk.read(path).trim())
const permalinkSet = new Set()
tree.forEach(node => {
  let permalink = jtree.Utils.stringToPermalink(node.get("primaryTitle"))
  let counter = ""
  let dash = ""
  while (permalinkSet.has(permalink + dash + counter)) {
    dash = "-"
    counter = counter ? counter + 1 : 2
  }
  const finalPermalink = permalink + dash + counter
  permalinkSet.add(finalPermalink)
  // Delete Null values:
  node.forEach(field => {
    if (field.getContent() === "\\N") field.destroy()
  })
  if (node.get("originalTitle") === node.get("primaryTitle")) node.getNode("originalTitle").destroy()
  Disk.write(`${__dirname}/../imdb/${folder}/${finalPermalink}.title`, node.childrenToString())
})</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The script iterates over each node and creates a file for each row in the TSV.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This script required a few design decisions. For permalink uniqueness, I simply keep a set of titles and number them if a name comes up multiple times. There's also the question of what to do with nulls. IMDB sets the value to <code>\N</code>. Generally the TreeBase way is to not include the field in question. So I filtered out null values. For cases where <code>primaryTitle === originalTitle</code>, I stripped the latter. For the Genres field, it's a CSV array. I'd like to make that follow the TreeBase convention of a SSV. I don't know all the possibilities though without iterating, so I'll just skip this for now.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here are the results of the script for the small 60 file TreeBase:</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Building the Grammar File</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The Grammar file adds some intelligence to a TreeBase. You can think of it as the schema for your base. TreeBase scripts can read those Grammar files and then do things like provide type checking or syntax highlighting.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now that we have a sample <code>title</code> file, I'm going to take a first pass at the grammar file for our TreeBase. I copied the file <code>the-photographical-congress-arrives-in-lyon.title</code> and pasted it into the right side of the <a href="https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/">Tree Language Designer</a>. Then I clicked <code>Infer Prefix Grammar</code>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That gave me a decent starting point for the grammar:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">inferredLanguageNode

<p class="scrollParagraph">The generated grammar needed a little work. I renamed the root node and added catchAlls and a base "abstractFactType". The Grammar language and tooling for TreeBase is very new, so all that should improve as time goes on.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My <code>title.grammar</code> file now looks like this:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">titleNode

<p class="scrollParagraph">Next I coped that file into the <code>60</code> folder with <code>cp /Users/breck/imdb/title.grammar 60/</code>. I have the <code>jtree</code> package installed on my local machine so I registered this new language with that with the command <code>jtree register /Users/breck/imdb/title.grammar</code>. Finally, I generated a Sublime syntax file for these title files with <code>jtree sublime title #pathToMySublimePluginDir</code>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now I have rudimentary syntax highlighting for these new title files:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="sublimeText.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="sublimeText.png" width="425" height="253" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Notice the syntax highlighting is a little broken. The Sublime syntax generating <a href="https://github.com/treenotation/jtree/issues/8">still needs some work</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Anyway, now we've got the basics done. We have a script for turning our CSV rows into Tree Notation files and we have a basic schema/grammar for our new TreeBase.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's get started with the bigger tests now.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A 6k TreeBase</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm expecting this to be an easy one. I update my script to target the 6k files and run it with <code>/Users/breck/imdb/build.js</code>. A little alarmingly, it takes a couple of seconds to run:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">real  0m3.144s
user  0m1.203s
sys 0m1.646s</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The main script is going to iterate over 1,000x as many items so if this rate holds up it would take 50 minutes to generate the 6M TreeBase!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I do have some optimization ideas in mind, but for now let's explore the results.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First, let me build a catalog of typical tasks that I do with TreeBase that I will try to repeat with the 6k, 60k, 600k, and 6.5M TreeBases.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'll just list them in Tree Notation:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">task ls

<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 Before I get to the results, let me note I had 2 bugs. First I needed to update my <code>title.grammar</code> file by adding a <code>cells fileNameCell</code> to the root node and also adding a <code>fileNameCell</code> line. Second, my strategy above of putting the CSV file for each TreeBase into the same folder as the TreeBase was not ideal as Sublime Text would open that file as well. So I moved each file up with <code>mv titles.tsv ../6k.titles.tsv</code>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The results for 6k are below.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">So 6k worked without a hitch. Not surprising as this is in the ballpark of where I normally operate with TreeBases.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 This markdown file that I'm writing was in the parent folder of the 60k directory and Sublime text seemed to be slowing a bit, so I closed Sublime and created a new unrelated folder to hold this writeup separate from the TreeBase folders.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The build script for the 60k TreeBase took 30 seconds or so, as expected. I can optimize for that later.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">Uh oh. Already I am noticing some scaling delays with a few of these tasks.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 The first <code>git add</code> took about 1 minute. I used to know the internals of Git well but that was a decade ago and my knowledge is rusty.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I will now look some stuff up. Could Git be creating 1 file for each file in my TreeBase? I found <a href="https://www.monperrus.net/martin/one-million-files-on-git-and-github">this post</a> from someone who created a Git repo with 1.7M files which should turn out to contain useful information. From that post it looks like you can indeed expect 1 file for Git for each file in the project.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The first <code>git commit</code> took about 10 seconds. Why? Git printed a message about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8633981/what-does-auto-packing-the-repository-for-optimum-performance-mean/16233094">Autopacking</a>. It seems Git will combine a lot of small files into packs (perhaps in bundles of 6,700, though I haven't dug in to this) to speed things up. Makes sense.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 I forgot to mention, while doing the tasks for the 60k TreeBase, my computer fan kicked on. A brief look at Activity Monitor showed a number of <code>mdworker_shared</code> processes using single digit CPU percentages each, which appears to be some <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8510132">OS level indexing process</a>. That's hinting that a bigger TreeBase might require at least some basic OS/file system config'ing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Besides the delays with <code>git</code> everything else seemed to remain fast. The 60k TreeBase choked a little more than I'd like but seems with a few tweaks things could remain screaming fast.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's move on to the first real challenge.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A 600k TreeBase</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 The first problem I hit immediately in that my <code>build.js</code> is not efficient. I hit a v8 out of memory error. I could solve this by either 1) streaming the TSV one row at a time or 2) cleaning up the unoptimized jtree library to handle bigger data better. I chose to spend a few minutes and go with option 1).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 It appears the first build script started writing files to the 600k directory before it failed. I had to <code>rm -rf 600k/</code> and that took a surprisingly long time. Probably a minute or so. Something to keep an eye on.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣  I updated my build script to use streams. Unfortunately the streaming <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/csv-parse">csv parser</a> I switched to choked on line 32546. Inspecting that vicinity it was hard to detect what it was breaking on. Before diving in I figured I'd try a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/csv-parser">different library</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 The new library seemed to be working but it was taking a while so I added some instrumentation to the script. From those logs the new script seems to generate about 1.5k files per second. So should take about 6 minutes for all 600k. For the 6.5M files, that would grow to an hour, so perhaps there's more optimization work to be done here.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 Unfortunately the script exited early with:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">Error: ENAMETOOLONG: name too long, open '/Users/breck/imdbPost/../imdb/600k/mord-an-lottomillionr-karl-hinrich-charly-l.sexualdelikt-an-carola-b.bankangestellter-zweimal-vom-selben-bankruber-berfallenmord-an-lottomillionr-karl-hinrich-charly-l.sexualdelikt-an-carola-b.bankangestellter-zweimal-vom-selben-bankruber-berfallen01985nncrimenews.title'</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Turns out the Apple File System has a filename <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems">size limit</a> of 255 UTF-8 characters so this error is understandable. However, inspecting the filename shows that for some reason the permalink was generated by combining the original title with the primary title. Sounds like a bug.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I <code>cd</code> into the <code>600k</code> directory to see what's going on.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 Unfortunately <code>ls</code> hangs. <code>ls -f -1 -U</code> seems to go faster.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The titles look correct. I'm not sure why the script got hung up on that one entry. For now I'll just wrap the function call in a Try/Catch and press on. I should probably make this script resumable but will skip that for now.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Rerunning the script...it worked! That line seemed to be the only problematic line.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We now have our 600k TreeBase.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 <code>ls</code> is now nearly unusable. <code>ls -f -1 -U</code> takes about 30 seconds. A straight up <code>ls</code> takes about 45s.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 Sublime Text failed to open. After 10 minutes of 100% CPU usage and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_pinwheel">beachball'ing</a> I force quit the program. I tried twice to be sure with the same result.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 <code>mdworker_shared</code> again kept my laptop running hot. I found a way of potentially <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/30/exclude-drives-or-folders-from-spotlight-index-mac-os-x/">disabling Mac OS X Spotlight Indexing</a> of the IMDB folder.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 Opening the <code>600k</code> folder in Apple's Finder gave me a loading screen for about 3 minutes</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="600k-finder-loading.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="600k-finder-loading.png" width="530" height="647" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At least it eventually came up:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="600k-finder.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="600k-finder.png" width="547" height="592" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, how about Git?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 The first <code>git add .</code> took <em>40 minutes</em>! Yikes.</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">real  39m30.215s
user  1m19.968s
sys 13m49.157s</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 <code>git status</code> after the initial git add took about a minute.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 The first <code>git commit</code> after the git add took about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">GitHub turns out to be a real champ. Even with 600k files the first <code>git push</code> took less than 30 seconds.</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">real  0m22.406s
user  0m2.657s
sys 0m1.724s</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The <a href="https://github.com/breck7/600k">600k repo</a> on GitHub comes up near instantly. GitHub just shows the first 1k out of 600k files which I think is a good compromise, and far better than a multiple minute loading screen.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 Sadly there doesn't seem to be any pagination for this situation on GitHub, so not sure how to view the rest of the directory contents.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I can pull up a file quickly on GitHub, like the entry for <a href="https://github.com/breck7/600k/blob/master/007-licence-to-kill.title">License to Kill</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How about editing files locally? Sublime is no use so I'll use <code>vim</code>. Because <code>ls</code> is so slow, I'll find the file I want to edit on GitHub. Of course because I can't find pagination in GitHub I'll be limited to editing one of the first 1k files. I'll use just that License to Kill entry.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So the command I use <code>vim 007-licence-to-kill.title</code>. Editing that file is simple enough. Though I wish we had support for Tree Notation in vim to get syntax highlighting and such.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 Now I do <code>git add .</code>. Again this takes a while. What I now realize is that my fancy command prompt does some <code>git status</code> with every command. So let's disable that.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After going in and cleaning up my shell (including switching to zsh) I've got a bit more performance back on the command line.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 But just a bit. A <code>git status</code> still takes about 23 seconds! Even with the <code>-uno</code> option it takes about 15 seconds. This is with 1 modified file.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now adding this 1 file seems tricky. Most of the time I do a <code>git status</code> and see that I want to add everything so I do a <code>git add .</code>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 But I tried <code>git add .</code> in the 600k TreeBase and after 100 seconds I killed the job. Instead I resorted to <code>git add 007-licence-to-kill.title</code> which worked pretty much instantly.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 <code>git commit</code> for this 1 change took about 20 seconds. Not too bad but much worse than normal.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><code>git push</code> was just a few seconds.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was able to <a href="https://github.com/breck7/600k/blob/master/007-licence-to-kill.title">see the change on GitHub</a> instantly. Editing that file on GitHub and committing was a breeze. Looking at the change history and blame on GitHub was near instant.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Git blame locally was also just a couple of seconds.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Pause to Reflect</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So TreeBase struggles at the 600k level. You cannot just use TreeBase at the 100k level without preparing your system for it. Issues arise with GUIs like Finder and Sublime, background file system processes, shells, git, basic bash utilities, and so forth.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I haven't looked yet into RAM based file systems or how to setup my system to make this use case work well, but for now, out of the box, I cannot recommend TreeBase for databases of more than 100,000 entities.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Is there even a point now to try 6.5M? Arguably no.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">However, I've come this far! No turning back now.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A 6.5M TreeBase</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">To recap what I am doing here: I am taking a single 6.5 million row 500MB TSV file that could easily be parsed into a SQLite or other battle hardened database and instead turning it into a monstrous 6.5 million file TreeBase backed by Git and writing it to my hard disk with no special configuration.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By the way, I forgot to mention my system specs for the record. I'm doing this on a MacBook Air running macOS Catalina on a 2.2Ghz Dual-core i7 with 8GB of 1600 Mhz DDR3 Ram with a 500GB Apple SSD using APFS. This is the last MacBook with a great keyboard, so I really hope it doesn't break.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Okay, back to the task at hand.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I need to generate the 6.5M files in a single directory. The 600k TreeBase took 6 minutes to generate so if that scales linearly 6.5M should take an hour. The first <code>git add</code> for 600k took 40 minutes, so that for 6.5M could take 6 hours. The first <code>git commit</code> for 600k took 10 minutes, so potentially 1.5 hours for 6.5M. So this little operation might take about 10 hours.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'll stitch these operations together into a shell script and run it overnight (I'll make sure to check the batteries in my smoke detectors first).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here's the script to run the whole routine:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">time node buildStream.js
time cd ~/imdb/6m/
time git add .
time git commit -m "initial commit"
time git push</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Whenever running a long script, it's smart to test it with a smaller dataset first. I successfully tested this script with the 6k file dataset. Everything worked. Everything should be all set for the final test.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">(Later the next day...)</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">It's Alive!</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It worked!!! I now have a TreeBase with over 6 million files in a single directory. Well, a few things worked, most things did not.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 There was a slight hiccup in my script where somehow v8 again ran out of memory. But only after creating 6,340,000 files, which is good enough for my purposes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 But boy was this slow! The creation of the 6M+ files took 3 hours and 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣  The first <code>git add .</code> took a whopping 12 hours!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 The first <code>git commit</code> took 5 hours!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 A few times when I checked on the machine it was running hot. Not sure if from CPU or Disk or a combination.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 I eventually quit <code>git push</code>. It quickly completed <code>Counting objects: 6350437, done.</code> but then nothing happened except lots of CPU usage for hours.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Although most programs failed, I was at least able to successfully create this monstrosity and navigate the folder.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The experiment has completed. I took a perfectly usable 6.5M row TSV file and transformed it into a beast that brings some of the most well-known programs out there to their knees.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">💣 NOTE: I do not recommend trying this at home. My laptop became lava hot at points. Who knows what wear and tear I added to my hard disk.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What have I learned?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So that is the end of the experiment. Can you build a Git-backed TreeBase with 6.5M files in a single folder? Yes. Should you? No. Most of your tools won't work or will be far too slow. There's infrastructure and design work to be done.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was actually pleasantly surprised by the results of this early test. I was confident it was going to fail but I wasn't sure exactly how it would fail and at what scale. Now I have a better idea of that. TreeBase currently sucks at the 100k level.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I also now know that the hardware for this type of system feels ready and it's just parts of some software systems that need to be adapted to handle folders with lots of files. I think those software improvements across the stack will be made and this dumb thing could indeed scale.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What's Next?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, my focus at the moment is not on big TreeBases. My focus is on making the experience of working with little TreeBases great. I want to help get things like <a href="https://github.com/treenotation/jtree/issues/2">Language Server Protocol</a> going for TreeBases and a Content Management System backed by TreeBase.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I now can envision how, once the tiny TreeBase experience is nailed, you should be able to use this for bigger tasks. The infrastructure is there to make it feasible with just a few adjustments. There are some config tweaks that can be made, more in-memory approaches, and some straightforward algorithmic additions to make to a few pieces of software. I also have had some fun conversations where people have suggested good sharding strategies that may prove useful without changing the simplicity of the system.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That being said, it would be fun to do this experiment again but this time try and make it work. Once that's a success, it would be fun to try and scale it another 100x, and try to build a TreeBase for something like the 180M paper <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a> dataset.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why Oh Why TreeBase?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Okay, you might be wondering what is the point of this system? Specifically, why use the file system and why use Tree Notation?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">1) The File System is Going to Be Here for a Long Long Time</h1>

<p class="scrollParagraph">1) About 30m programmers use approximately 100 to 500 general purpose programming languages. All of these actively used general purpose languages have battle tested APIs for interacting with file systems. They don't all have interfaces to every database program. Any programmer, no matter what language they use, without having to learn a new protocol, language, or package, could write code to interact with a TreeBase using knowledge they already have. Almost every programmer uses Git now as well, so they'd be familiar with how TreeBase change control works.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">2) Over one billion more casual users are familiar with using their operating system tools for interacting with Files (like Explorer and Finder). Wouldn't it be cool if they could use tools they already know to interact with structured data?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Wouldn't it be cool if we could combine sophisticated type checking, querying, and analytical capabilities of databases with the simplicity of files? Programmers can easily build GUIs on top of TreeBase that have any and all of the functionality of traditional database-backed programs but have the additional advantage of an extremely well-known access vector to their information.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People have been predicting the death of files but these predictions are wrong. Even Apple recently backtracked and added a Files interface to iOS. Files and folders aren't going anywhere. It's a very simple and useful design pattern that works in the analog and digital realm. Files have been around for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus">at least 4,500 years</a> and my guess is will be around for another 5,000 years, if the earth doesn't blow up. Instead of dying, on the contrary file systems will keep getting better and better. </p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">2) Tree Notation is All You Need to Create Meaningful Semantic Content</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People have recognized the value of semantic, strongly typed content for a long time. Databases have been strongly typed since the beginning of databases. Strongly typed programming languages have dominated the software world since the beginning of software.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People have been attempting to build a system for collaborative semantic content for decades. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">OWL2</a>, <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>, <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>—these are all great projects. I just think they can be simplified and I think one strong refinement is Tree Notation.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I imagine a world where you can effortlessly pass TreeBases around and combine them in interesting ways. As a kid I used to collect baseball cards. I think it would be cool if you could just as easily pass around "cards" like a "TreeBase of all the World's Medicines" or a "TreeBase of all the world's academic papers" or a "TreeBase of all the world's chemical compounds" and because I know how to work with one TreeBase I could get value out of any of these TreeBases. Unlike books or weakly typed content like Wikipedia, TreeBases are computable. They are like specialized little brains that you can build smart things out of.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So I think this could be pretty cool. As dumb as it is.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I would love to hear your thoughts.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 23, 2020 — </span>People make biased claims all the time. A decent response used to be "citation needed". But we should demand more. Anytime someone makes a claim that seems biased, call them out with: <strong><em>Dataset needed</em></strong>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Whether it's an academic paper, news article, blog post, tweet, comment or ad, linking to analyses is not enough. If someone stops at that, demand a link to a clean dataset supporting the author's position. If they can't deliver, they should retract.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Of course, most sources don't currently publish their datasets. <strong>You cannot trust claims from any person or organization without an easily accessible dataset.</strong> In fact, it's probably safe to assume when someone shares a conclusion without the accompanying dataset that they are distorting reality for their own benefit.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 20, 2020 — </span>In this post I briefly describe eleven threads in languages and programming. Then I try to connect them together to make some predictions about the future of knowledge encoding.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This might be hard to follow unless you have experience working with types, whether that be types in programming languages, or types in databases, or types in Excel. Actually, this may be hard to follow regardless of your experience. I'm not sure I follow it. Maybe just stay for the links. Skimming is encouraged.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">First, from the Land of Character Sets</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Humans invented characters roughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_first_written_accounts">5,000 years ago</a>.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">Binary notation</a> was invented roughly 350 years ago.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The first widely adopted system for using binary notation to represent characters was ASCII, which was created only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">60 years ago</a>. ASCII encodes little more than the characters used by English.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In 1992 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8 was designed</a> which went on to become the first widespread system that encodes all the characters for all the world's languages.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>For about 99.6% of recorded history we did not have a globally used system to encode all human characters into a single system. Now we do.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in the Land of Standards Organization</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Scientific standards are the original type schemas. Until recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_organization">Standards Organizations</a> dominated the creation of standards.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You might be familiar with terms like meter, gram, amp, and so forth. These are well defined units of measure that were pinned down in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">International System of Units</a>, which was first published in 1960.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) began around 100 years ago and is the organization behind a number of <a href="https://www.iso.org/popular-standards.html">popular standards</a> from <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html">currency codes</a> to <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html">date and time</a> formats.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>For 98% of recorded history we did not have global standards. Now we do.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in Math Land</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My grasp of the history of mathematics isn't strong enough to speak confidently to trends in the field, but I do want to mention that in the past century there has been a lot of important research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theories</a>.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the past 100 years type theories have taken their place as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics">foundation of mathematics</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>For 98% of recorded history we did not have strong theories of type systems. Now we do.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in Programming Language Land</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The research into mathematical type and set theories in the 1900's led directly into the creation of useful new programming languages and programming language features.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus">typed lambda calculus in the 1940's</a> to the static type system in languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language">C</a> to the ongoing experiments of <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> or the rapid growth of the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript ecosystem</a>, the research into types has led to hundreds of software inventions.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the late 1990's and 2000's, a slew of programming languages that underutilized innovations from type theory in the name of easier prototyping, like Python and Ruby and Javascript, became very popular. For a while this annoyed programmers who understood the benefits of type systems. But now they too are benefiting, as there is a bigger demand for richer type systems now due to the increase in the number of programmers.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>95%+ of the most popular programming languages use increasingly smarter type systems.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in API Land</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Before the Internet became widespread, the job of most programmers was to write software that interacted only with other software on the local machine. That other software was generally under their control or well documented.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the late 1990's and 2000's, a big new market arose for programmers to write software that could interact over the Internet with software on other machines that they had no control of or knowledge about.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At first there was not a good standard language to use that was agreed upon by many people. 1996's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">SGML</a> from 1986, was the first attempt to get some traction for this job. But XML and the dialects of XML for APIs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP (1998)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language">WSDL (2000)</a> were not easy to use. Then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a> created a new language called <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> in 2001. JSON made web API programming easier and helped create a huge wave of web API businesses. For me this was great. In the beginning of my programming career I got jobs working on these new JSON APIs.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The main advantage that JSON had over XML was simple, well defined types. It had just a few primitive types—like numbers, booleans and strings—and a couple of complex types—lists and dicts. It was a very useful collection of structures that were important across all programming languages, put together in a simple and concise way. It took very little time to learn the entire thing. In contrast, XML was "extensible" and defined no types, leading to many massive dialects defined by committee.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>For 99.8% of recorded history we did not have a global network conducting automated business transactions with a typed language. Now we do.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in SQL Land</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When talking about types and data one must pay homage to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> databases, which store most of the world's structured data and perform the transactions that our businesses depend on.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">SQL programmers spend a lot of time thinking about the structure of their data and defining it well in a SQL <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language">data definition language</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Types play a huge role in SQL. The dominant SQL databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle all contain common primitives like ints, floats, and strings. Most of the main SQL databases also have more extensive type systems for things like dates and money and even geometric primitives like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype-geometric.html">circles and polygons</a> in PostgreSQL.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Critical information is stored in strongly typed SQL databases: Financial information; information about births, health and deaths; information about geography and addresses; information about inventories and purchase histories; information about experiments and chemical compounds.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>98% of the world's most valuable, processed information is now stored in typed databases.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in the Land of Types as Code</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The standards we get from the Standards Organizations are vastly better than not having standards, but in the past they've been released as non-computable, weakly typed documents.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There are lots of projects that are now writing schemas in computable languages. The <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org project</a> is working to build a common global database of rich type schemas. <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON LD</a> aims to make the types of JSON more extensible. The <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> project has a rich collection of commonly used interfaces. <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Protocol buffers</a> and <a href="https://capnproto.org/">similar</a> are another approach at language agnostic schemas. There are <a href="https://www.typedefs.com/">attempts</a> at languages just for types. <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> has a useful schema language with rich typing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>100% of standards/type schemas can now themselves be written in strongly typed documents.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in Git Land</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> is a distributed version control system created in 2005.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Git can be used to store and track changes to any type of data. You could theoretically put all of the English Wikipedia in Git, then CAPITALIZE all verbs, and save that as a single patch file. Then you could post your patch to the web and say "I propose the new standard is we should CAPITALIZE all verbs. Here's what it would look like." While this is a dumb idea, it demonstrates how Git makes it much cheaper to iterate on standards. Someone can propose both a change to the standard and the global updates all in a single operation. Someone can fork and branch to their heart's content.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>For 99.9% of recorded history, there was not a cheap way to experiment and evolve type schemas nor a safe way to roll them out. Now there is.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in Hub Land</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the past 30 years, central code hubs have emerged. There were early ones like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> but in the past ten years <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> has become the breakout star. GitHub has around 30 million users, which is also a good estimate of the total number of programmers worldwide, meaning nearly every programmer uses git.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In addition to source code hubs, package hubs have become quite large. Some early pioneers are still going strong like 1993's <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a> but the breakout star is 2010's <a href="http://npmjs.com/">NPM</a>, which has more packages than the package managers of all other languages combined. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Types are arbitrary. The utility of a type depends not only on its intrinsic utility but also on its popularity. You can create a better type system—maybe a simpler universal day/time schema—but unless it gains popularity it will be of limited value.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Code hubs allow the sharing of code, including type definitions, and can help make type definitions more popular, which also makes them more useful.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>99% of programmers now use code hubs and hubs are a great place to increase adoption of types, making them even more useful.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in Semantic Web Land</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The current web is a collection of untyped HTML pages. So if I were to open a web page with lots of information about diseases and had a semantic question requiring some computation, I'd have to read the page myself and use my slow brain to parse the information and then figure out the answer to my semantic question.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">The Semantic Web dream</a> is that the elements on web pages would be annotated with type information so the computer could do the parsing for us and compute the answers to our semantic questions.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">While the "Semantic Web" did not achieve adoption like the untyped web, that dream remains very relevant and is ceaselessly worked upon. In a sense <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> embodies an early version of the type of UX that was envisioned for the Semantic Web. The typed data in Wolfram Alpha comes from a nicely <a href="https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/">curated collection</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">While lots of strongly typed proprietary databases exist on the web for various domains from <a href="http://imdb.com/">movies</a> to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">startups</a> and while Wikipedia is arguable undergoing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing">gradual typing</a>, the open web still remains largely untyped and we don't have a universally accessible interface yet to the world's typed information.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>99% of the web is untyped while 99% of the world's typed information is silo-ed and proprietary.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Meanwhile, in Deep Learning Land</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Deep Learning is creeping in everywhere. In the past decade it has come to be the dominant strategy for NLP. In the past two years, a new <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">general</a> learning strategy has become <a href="https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT">feasible</a> where models learn some intrinsic structure of language and can use this knowledge to perform many different language tasks.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">One of those tasks could be to rewrite untyped data in a typed language.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>AI may soon be able to write a strongly typed semantic web from the weakly typed web.</strong></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Tying All These Threads Together</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I see a global pattern here that I call the "Type the World" trend. Here are some future predictions from these past trends.</p>
</div></div>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >We will always have creative, ambiguous, untyped human languages where new ideas can evolve freely</li>
<li >In the future great new ideas from the untyped realm will be adopted faster by the typed realm</li>
<li >Nearly all transactions in business and government will be in typed languages</li>
<li >Someone will invent a wildly popular new domain specific language(s) for type definitions</li>
<li >All the popular standards will be ones written in these new and improved TypeDSLs</li>
<li >Git—or git like systems—will be used to store both the TypeDSLs and the typed data</li>
<li >TypeHubs will arise hosting these widely used type schemas</li>
<li >Programmers will get their types from TypeHubs regardless of which programming language they use</li>
<li >Deep learning agents will be used to rewrite the web's untyped data into typed data</li>
<li >Deep learning agents will be used to improve type schemas</li>
<li >Human editors will review and sign off on the typing work of the deep learning agents</li>
<li >Silo-ed domain specific standards will merge into one or a handful of global monolithic type systems</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The result of this will be a future where all business, from finance to shopping to healthcare to law, is conducted in a rich, open type system, and untyped language work is relegated to research, entertainment and leisure.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">While I didn't dive into the benefits of what Type the World will bring, and instead merely pointed out some trends that I think indicate it is happening, I do indeed believe it will be a fantastic thing. Maybe I'll give my take on why Type the World is a great thing in a future post.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="if-stories-are-lies-why-do-they-work.html">If stories are lies why do they work?</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 16, 2020 — </span>I often <a href="https://breckyunits.com/narratives-misrepresent-complex-systems.html">rail</a> <a href="https://breckyunits.com/english-cannot-encode-real-news.html">against</a> <a href="https://breckyunits.com/dreaming-of-a-data-checked-language.html">narratives</a>. I think stories always oversimplify things, have hindsight bias, and often mislead. I spend a lot of time trying to invent tools for making data derived thinking as effortless as narrative thinking (so far, mostly in vain). And yet, as much as I rail on stories, I have to admit stories work.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I read an article that put it more succinctly:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Why storytelling?
Simple: nothing else works.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I would agree with that. Despite the fact that 90% of stories are lies, they motivate people better than anything else. Stories make people feel something. They get people going.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What is the math here? On a population level, it seems people who follow stories have a survival advantage. On a local level, it seems people who can weave stories have an even greater survival advantage.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Why?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps it's due to risk taking. Perhaps the people who follow stories take more risks, on average, than people who don't, and even though many of those don't pan out some of those risks do pay off and the average is worth it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps it's due to productivity. Perhaps people who are storiers spend less time analyzing and more time doing. The act of doing generates experience (data), so often the best way to be data-driven isn't to analyze more it's to go out there and do more to collect more data. As they say in machine learning, data trumps algorithms.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps it's due to focus. If you just responded to your senses all the time the world is a shimmering place, and perhaps narratives are necessary to get anything done at all.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps it's due to memory. A story like 'The Boy who Cried Wolf' is shorter and more memorable than  'Table of Results from a Randomized Experiment on the Effect of False Alarms on Subsequent Human Behavior'.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps it's healthier. Our brains are not much more advanced than the chimp. Uncertainty can create stress and anxiety. Perhaps the confidence that comes from belief in a story leads to less stress and anxiety leading to better health, which outweighs any downsides from decisions that go against the data.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps it's a cooperation advantage. If everyone is analyzing their individual decisions all the time, perhaps that comes at the cost of cooperation. Storiers go along with the group story, and so over time their populations get more done together. Maybe the opposite of stories isn't truth, it's anarchy.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps it's just more fun. Maybe stories are suboptimal for decision making and lead us astray all the time, and yet are still a survival advantage simply because it's a more enjoyable way to live. Even when you screw up royally, it can make a good story. As the saying goes, "don't take life too seriously, you'll never make it out alive."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Despite my problems with narratives and my quest for something better, it seems quite possible to me that at the end of the day it may turn out that there is nothing better, and it's best to make peace with stories, despite their flaws. And regardless of the future, I can't argue with the value of stories today for motivation and enjoyment. Nothing else works.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

But there's no equivalent to a spell checker for data errors and when you look for them you see them everywhere.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Pandemic: An Experiment</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Data errors are so pervasive that I came up with a hypothesis today and put it to the test. My hypothesis was this: <strong>100% of "reputable" publications will have at least one data error on their front page</strong>.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Method</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I wrote down 10 reputable sources off the top of my head: the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/">WSJ</a>, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/">Nature</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera</a>, <a href="https://hbr.org/">Harvard Business Review</a>, <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News: Science</a>, the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/home">FDA</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For each source, I went to their website and took a single screenshot of their homepage, above the fold, and skimmed their top stories for data errors.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Results</h1>
</div></div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="dataErrorPandemic.jpg" target="_blank"  ><img src="dataErrorPandemic.jpg" width="1185" height="1200" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the screenshots above, you can see that 10/10 of these publications had data errors front and center.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Breaking Down These Errors</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Data errors in English fall into common categories. My working definition provides three: a lack of dataset and/or definitions, a bad reduction, or a lack of integrated context. There could be more, this experiment is just a starting point where I'm naming some of the common patterns I see.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The top article in the WSJ begins with "Tensions Rise in the Middle East". There are at least 2 data errors here. First is the <strong>Lack of Dataset</strong> error. Simply put: you need a dataset to make a statement like that. There is no longitudinal dataset in that article on tensions in the Middle East. There is also a <strong>Lack of Definitions</strong>. Sometimes you can not yet have a dataset but at least define what a dataset would be that could back your assertions. In this case we have neither a dataset nor a definition of what some sort of "Tensions" dataset would look like.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the New England Journal of Medicine, the lead figure shows "excessive alcohol consumption is associated with atrial fibrillation" between 2 groups. One group had 0 drinks over a 6 month period and the other group had over 250 drinks (10+ per week). There was a small impact on atrial fibrillation. This is a classic <strong>Lack of Integrated Context</strong> data error. If you were running a lightbulb factory and found soaking lightbulbs in alcohol made them last longer, that might be an important observation. But humans are not as disposable, and health studies must always include <strong>integrated context</strong> to explore whether there is something of significance. Having one group make any sort of similar drastic lifestyle change will likely have some impact on any measurement. A good rule of thumb is anything you read that includes p-values to explain why it is significant is not significant.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In Nature we see the line "world's growing water shortage". This is a <strong>Bad Reduction</strong>, another very common data error. While certain areas have a water shortage, other areas have a surplus. Any time you see a broad diverse things grouped into one term, or "averages", or "medians", it's usually a data error. You always need access to the data, and you'll often see a more complex distribution that would prevent broad true statements like those.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In The Economist the lead story talks about an action that "will have profound consequences for the region". Again we have the <strong>Lack of Definitions</strong> error. We also have a <strong>Forecast without a Dataset</strong> error. There's nothing wrong with making a forecast--creating a hypothetical dataset of observations about the future--but one needs to actually create and publish that dataset and not just a vague unfalsifiable statement.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The New Yorker lead paragraph claims an event "was the most provocative U.S. act since...". I'll save you the suspense: the article did not include a thorough dataset of such historical acts with a defined measurement of provocative. Another <strong>Lack of Dataset</strong> error.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In Al Jazeera we see "Iran is transformed" and also a <strong>Bad Reduction</strong>, <strong>Lack of Dataset</strong> and <strong>Lack of Definition</strong> errors.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Harvard Business Review has a lead article about the Post-Holiday funk. In that article the phrase "research...suggests" is often a dead giveaway for a <strong>Hidden Data</strong> error, where the data is behind a paywall and even then often inscrutable. Anytime someone says "studies/researchers/experts" it is a data error.  We all know the earth revolves around the sun because we can all see the data for ourselves. Don't trust any data you don't have access to.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Google News has a link to an interesting article on the invention of a new type of color changing fiber, but the article goes beyond the matter at hand to make the claim: "What Exactly Makes One Knot Better Than Another Has Not Been Well-Understood – Until Now". There is a <strong>Lack of Dataset</strong> error for meta claims about the <em>knowledge of knot models</em>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The FDA's lead article is on the Flu and begins with the words "Most viral respiratory infections...", then proceeds for many paragraphs with zero datasets. There is an overall huge <strong>Lack of Datasets</strong> in that article. There's also a <strong>Lack of Monitoring</strong>. Manufacturing facilities are a controlled, static environment. In uncontrolled, heterogeneous environments like human health, things are always changing, and to make ongoing claims without having infrastructure in place to monitor and adjust to changing data is a data error.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The NIH has an article on how increased exercise may be linked to reduced cancer risk. This is actually an informative article with 42 links to many studies with lots of datasets, however the huge data error here is <strong>Lack of Integration</strong>. It is very commendable to do the grunt work and gather the data to make a case, but simply linking to static PDFs is not enough—they must be integrated. Not only does that make it much more useful, but if you've never tried to integrate them, you have no idea if the pieces actually will fit together to support your claims.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">While my experiment didn't touch books or essays, I'm quite confident the hypothesis will hold in those realms as well. If I flipped through some "reputable" books or essayist collections I'm 99.9% confident you'd see the same classes of errors. This site is no exception.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Problem is Language Tools</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I don't think anyone's to blame for the proliferation of data errors. I think it's still relatively recent that we've harnessed the power of data in specialized domains, and no one has yet invented ways to easily and fluently incorporate true data into our human languages.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="dataError">Human languages have absorbed a number of sublanguages over thousands of years</span> that have made it easier to communicate with ease in a more precise way. The base 10 number system  (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) is one example that made it a lot easier to utilize arithmetic.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Taking Inspiration from Programming Language Design</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Domains with low tolerance for data errors, <span class="dataError">like aeronautical engineering or computer chip design</span>, are heavily reliant on programming languages. I think it's worthwhile to explore the world of programming language design for ideas that might inspire improvements to our everyday human languages.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Some quick numbers for people not familiar with the world of programming languages. <span class="dataError">Around 10,000 computer languages have been released in history (most of them in the past 70 years)</span>. <span class="dataError">About 50-100 of those have more than a million users worldwide</span> and the names of some of them may be familiar to even non-programmers such as Java, Javascript, Python, HTML or Excel.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Not all programming languages are created equal. The designers of a language end up making <span class="dataError">thousands of decisions</span> about how their particular language works. While <span class="dataError">English has evolved with little guidance over millennia</span>, programming languages are often designed consciously by small groups and <span class="dataError">can evolve much faster</span>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Often the designers change a language to make it easier to do something good or harder to do something bad.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Sometimes what is good and bad is up to the whims of the designer. Imagine I was an overly optimistic person and decided that English was too boring or pessimistic. I may invent a language without periods, where all sentences must end with an exclamation point! I'll call it Relish!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="dataError">Most of the time though, as data and experience accumulates, a rough consensus emerges</span> about what is good and bad in language design (though this too seesaws).</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Typed Checked Languages</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">One of the patterns that has <span class="dataError">emerged</span> as generally a good thing over the decades to many languages is what's called "type checking". When you are programming you often create buckets that can hold values. For example, if you were programming a function that regulated how much power a jet engine should supply, you might take into account the reading from a wind speed sensor and so create a bucket named "windSpeed".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="dataError">Some languages</span> are designed to enforce stricter logic checking of your buckets to help catch mistakes. <span class="dataError">Others</span> will try to make your program work as written. For example, if later in your jet engine program you mistakenly assigned the indoor air temperature to the "windSpeed" bucket, the parsers of some languages would alert you while you are writing the program, while with some other languages you'd discover your error in the air. The former style of languages generally do this by having "type checking".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Type Checking of programming languages is somewhat similar to Grammar Checking of English, though it can be a lot more extensive. If you make a change in one part of the program in a typed language, the type checker can recheck the entire program to make sure everything still makes sense. This sort of thing would be very useful in a data checked language. If your underlying dataset changes and conclusions anywhere are suddenly invalid, it would be helpful to have the checker alert you.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps lessons learned from programing language design, like Type Checking, could be useful for building the missing data checker for English.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A Blue Squiggly to Highlight Data Errors</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps what we need is a new color of squiggly:</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">✅ Spell Checkers: <span class="redSquig">red squiggly</span></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">✅ Grammar Checkers: <span class="greenSquig">green squiggly</span></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">❌ Data Checkers: <span class="blueSquig">blue squiggly</span></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If we had a data checker that highlighted data errors <span class="dataError" title="Dataless Forecast. Lack of Definitions.">we would eventually see a drastic reduction in data errors</span>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If we had a checker for data errors appear today our screens <span class="dataError">would be full of blue</span>. For example, click the button below to highlight just some of the data errors on this page alone.</p>
<style id="styleHolder"></style><button class="bigButton" onclick="document.getElementById('styleHolder').innerHTML = '.dataError {text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: wavy;text-decoration-color: blue;}'">Highlight data errors</button>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">How Do We Reduce Data Errors?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If someone created a working data checker today and applied it to all of our top publications, <span class="dataError" title="Dataless Forecast">blue squigglies would be everywhere</span>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="dataError">It is very expensive and time consuming to build datasets</span> and make data driven statements without data errors, so am I saying until we can publish content free of data errors we should stop publishing most of our content? <strong>YES</strong>! If you don't have anything true to say, perhaps it's best not to say anything at all. At the very least, I wish all the publications above had disclaimers about how laden with data errors their stories are.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Of course I don't believe either of those are likely to happen. I think we are stuck with data errors until people have invented great new things so that it becomes a lot easier to publish material without data errors. I hope we somehow create a data checked language.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I still don't know what that looks like, exactly. I spend half my work time attempting to create such new languages and tools and the other half searching the world to see if someone else has already solved it. I feel like I'm making decent progress on both fronts but I still have no idea whether we are months or decades away from a solution.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">While I don't know what the solution will be, I would not be surprised if the following patterns play a big role in moving us to a world where data errors are extinct:</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">1. <strong>Radical increases in collaborative data projects</strong> It is very easy for a person or small group to crank out content laden with data errors. It takes small armies of people making steady contributions over a long time period to build the big datasets that can power content free of data errors.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">2. <strong>Widespread improvements in data usability</strong>. <span class="dataError">Lots of people and organizations have moved in the past decade to make more of their data open</span>. However, it generally <span class="dataError">takes hours</span> to become fluent with one dataset, and there are <span class="dataError">millions</span> of them out there. Imagine if it took you hours to ramp on a single English word. That's the state of data usability right now. We need widespread improvements here to make integrated contexts easier.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">3. <strong>Stop subsidizing content laden with data errors</strong>. We grant monopolies on information and so there's even more incentive to create stories laden with data errors—because there are more ways to lie than to tell the truth. We should revisit intellectual monopoly laws.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">4. <strong>Novel innovations in language</strong>. Throughout history novel new sublanguages have enhanced our cognitive abilities. Things like geometry, Hindu-Arabic numerals, calculus, binary notation, etc. I hope some innovators will create very novel data sublanguages that make it much easier to communicate with data and reduce data errors.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Have you invented a data checked language, or are working on one? If so, please get in touch.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Attempt to Capture Truth</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 19, 2019 — </span>Back in the 2000's <a href="https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">Nassim Taleb's books</a> set me on a new path in search of truth. One truth I became convinced of is that <a href="https://breckyunits.com/narratives-misrepresent-complex-systems.html">most stories are false due to oversimplification</a>. I largely stopped writing over the years because I didn't want to contribute more false stories, and instead I've been searching for and building new <a href="https://breckyunits.com/ohayo.html">forms of communication</a> and <a href="https://treenotation.org/">ways of representing data</a> that hopefully can get us closer to truth.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've tried my best to make my writings encode "real" and "true" information, but it's impossible to overcome the limitations of language. The longer any work of English writing is, the more inaccuracies it contains. This post itself will probably be more than 50% false.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But most people aren't aware of the problem.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Fake news is a great idea.</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then came DT and "fake news". One nice thing I can say about DT is that "fake news" is a great idea.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats.
@ Howard H. Aiken</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">..in science the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to the man to whom the idea first occurs.
@ Francis Darwin</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">DT has done a great job at spreading this idea. Hundreds of millions of people, at least, now are at least vaguely familiar that there's a serious problem, even if people can't describe precisely what that is. Some people mistakenly believe "their news" is real and their opponents' news is fake. It's all fake news.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What's the underlying problem?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">English is a fantastic story telling language that has been very effective at sharing stories, coordinating commerce and motivating armies, but English evolved in a simpler time with simpler technologies and far less understanding about how the world really works.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">English oversimplifies the world which makes it easy to communicate something to be done. English is a modern day cave painting language. Nothing motivates a person better than a good story, and that motivation was essential to get us out of the cave. It didn't matter so much in which direction people went, as long as they went in some direction together.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But we are now out of the cave, and it is not enough to communicate what is to be done. We have many more options now and it's important that we have langauges that can better decide what is the best thing to do.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What will a language that supports Real News look like?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Real News is starting to emerge in a few places. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com">WSJ</a> has long been on the forefront but newer things like <a href="http://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> are also popping up.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I don't know exactly what a language for truth will look like but I imagine it will have some of these properties:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >It will be a language that is hard to lie with</li>
<li >It will contain more numerics and be more data driven</li>
<li >It will be interactive, with assumptions made clear and adjustable by the reader</li>
<li >It will be blameable, with the source and history of every line and character auditable</li>
<li >It will be linked and auditable, with the ability to "go to definitions"</li>
<li >It will discourage obfuscation, and will make it easy to compare 2 representations and choose the simpler one</li>
<li >It will be more visual, expanding beyond character alphabets and embracing more charts and visualizations</li>
<li >It will be more Random Access, like bullet points</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">English and Sapir–Whorf</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I would say until we move away from English and other story-telling langauges to encodings that are better for truth telling, our thinking will also be limited.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.
– Alan Perlis</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">New languages designed for truth telling might not just be useful in our everyday lives, they could very much change the way we think.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Finally</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Again, to channel Taleb, I'm not saying English is bad. By all means, <em>enjoy the stories</em>. But just remember they are stories. If you are reading English, know that you are not reading Real News.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 13, 2023 — </span><em>Note: I originally published this anonymously on <a href="https://medium.com/@bipolarguy321/going-manic-with-a-fitbit-6e7209d4bb54">Medium</a>. I was too scared to reveal my name. I am less scared now. I feel we are close to an accurate model of this condition. I have a more sophisticated understanding now but will leave the post as is to reflect my understanding at the time.</em></p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="mania/3yrsSleepData.webp" target="_blank"  ><img src="mania/3yrsSleepData.webp" width="626" height="346" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 13, 2018 — </span>This is a story about how my FitBit logged a manic episode.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In mid-2017, I had a manic episode that led me to act impulsively, over-confidently and grandiosely. Like a textbook case of mania, I was filled with grand ideas and visions, rushed through life decisions (and a lot of my savings), and was positively euphoric.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This was not a fluke event. I had been stable for about 2 years, but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 13 years ago, and have had approximately 7 swings of varying severity since then.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But this episode had an epidemiological silver lining: my FitBit recorded it. I hope this story might help at least one other person suffering from bipolar disorder or encourage people working on using wearable tech for mental health treatments to keep up the promising work.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Sleep Tracking</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In November 2014, I started wearing a fitness band at all times. I now have about 160 consecutive weeks worth of sleep and other data.</p>
</div></div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="mania/hittingMania.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="mania/hittingMania.png" width="710" height="409" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The average FitBit user gets 6 hours and 38 minutes of sleep per night.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My average — when stable — was a bit over 8 hours a night. Lots of people — parents especially — don't have the luxury of sleeping so much, and I feel a bit selfish and lazy to sleep so much. But when I do sleep less, as we shall see, my brain handles it worse than most.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Beginning</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In May of 2016, I left my job to do some freelancing and work on an entrepreneurial software project. I was staying sane and getting over 7.5 hours of sleep per night.</p>
</div></div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="mania/avgHours.webp" target="_blank"  ><img src="mania/avgHours.webp" width="464" height="287" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But in April 2017, things changed. My sleep average dropped to a little over 6 hours per night. Compared to prior years, this was a 30% drop in sleep. But I wasn't tired. I felt more awake than I had been in years.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">On Thursday, May 3, I slept for 4 hours and 56 minutes — for no good reason. The next night I did it again. I was coding faster than ever and loving life to boot. Later that day in my journal I wrote, “Life is good. No. Life is fucking great!”</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="mania/taste.webp" target="_blank"  ><img src="mania/taste.webp" width="626" height="346" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Mania is like an invisible drug. I had been off it for years. I had been vigilant. But after a long stable period, I had forgotten and now my guard was down. I didn't recognize it as it was happening.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Looking back, this was probably the time to catch it. To go see my therapist. To get back on meds. To reveal my condition to some more people and ask for help.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Alas, I didn't do that. By chance, I spent the next three weeks at my girlfriend's on the East Coast and did calm down a bit. But I was not thinking, “Yikes! I was getting a bit manic there, I need to be careful.” Instead I was thinking, “Wow, I was in the zone a couple weeks ago — I gotta get back to that!” My mind had tasted mania again and was subconsciously itching to get more.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Episode</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Eager to get back to “the zone,” I impulsively bought a ticket back home and cut my trip to the East Coast short. I got back to coding and my work, and then, predictable as a clock, my countdown to mania began.</p>
</div></div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="mania/descent.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="mania/descent.png" width="600" height="371" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The above chart is weekly averages. But the day-to-day variance was extreme — a few nights I slept less than 3 hours — but I felt great!</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="mania/2hours.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="mania/2hours.png" width="673" height="416" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My behavior became textbook manic. My ideas and claims became more and more ambitious — topics that had seemed complex to me before suddenly seemed simple, I could learn anything, solve any problem, change industries.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">With my software project I started to feel the paranoid need to move fast — I got the delusion Google was also working on the same idea and was about to launch before me, stealing my thunder. Embarrassingly, I started publishing these grand claims, emailing past coworkers and employers, and started telling people I would win the Turing Prize.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My spending got wild. For example, on a trip during the episode, I spent $300 to upgrade my ticket to first class (at the time I thought it was worthwhile because I wrote a “brilliant” math proof on the plane), took a deluxe Uber for $70, and tipped a busker $100. My usual daily expenses were about $30. My monthly expenses had been about $3k a month, but now shot up to over $10k.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I can't believe I didn't know better, given more than a decade of experience with this condition. But at the time I was oblivious to what was driving me — in my mind there was a perfectly logical narrative explaining all my actions. Only now, looking at the sleep data, is it clear to me that physical brain conditions were contributing a huge amount to my behavior.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Confusing, Mixed Aftermath</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Following this acute episode, I had a couple months of mixed moods.</p>
</div></div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="mania/whatHappened.webp" target="_blank"  ><img src="mania/whatHappened.webp" width="626" height="346" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">July and August were particularly confusing. The problem of having ideas in a manic state is that you believe in them so fervently—ideas come hard and fast in what feels like a spiritual experience — that it becomes very hard to let those ideas and beliefs go. At times I questioned what the hell I was doing, but I had made lots of claims in public and did my best to try and prove them.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the months that followed, sleep was mixed. I was trying to “get back” to the energy levels and clarity that I had in June — I still hadn't recognized that time as manic — but was finding it hard to do so. I tried sleeping less to kickstart my system.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Far in the back of my head it was starting to occur to me that maybe I had gone manic again — that my ideas weren't so grand after all — but for months I strongly repressed those thoughts.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">December — Coming to Terms with the Data</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By December I couldn't go mixed anymore. I knew something was wrong and I finally started to reflect on the past.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Out of curiosity, I downloaded all my sleep data. What I saw confirmed my worst fears. When my sleep went out of control, so did my mania. When sleep decreased, grandiosity increased. Those long days weren't a result of groundbreaking work, but rather the result of a manic mind.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Tracking is Invaluable but Not a Cure</h1>

</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Wearables gave me great hope for curing my extreme mood issues. At first this was confirmed by my experience — once I started wearing a fitness band and regularly kept an eye on my sleep, I went on to have the longest mania-free period in my life. But now the data shows me that wearables by themselves are not a cure.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="mania/sleepTrackedMania.webp" target="_blank"  ><img src="mania/sleepTrackedMania.webp" width="1027" height="316" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Could Alerts Have Prevented It?</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There are a lot of things I could have done differently to prevent this manic episode from happening. After stabilizing, I went off my medication and hadn't visited my doctor for over 18 months. I screwed up.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I wonder what would have happened back in May if my wearable service had alerted my doctor and a few close friends of my foreboding sleep changes. Perhaps there could have been a minor intervention that prevented the huge swing?</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="mania/alertsIdea.webp" target="_blank"  ><img src="mania/alertsIdea.webp" width="626" height="346" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Of course, I know it's not as easy as alerts. I realize that if done in the wrong way, an alert service might make things worse — perhaps people might get paranoid and angry, rip the band off, and continue on their manic way.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But in the future perhaps someone will design an alert and intervention system that is effective and palatable. Perhaps the alert sets into motion something subtle and agreeable — the person agrees to take an extra medication for a time, check in with their therapist, or start filling out a daily mood journal for a month, et cetera.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Grateful for the Data</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I am hugely disappointed in myself for letting this happen but at least grateful to have the huge amount of sleep data this time, something I never had before.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Having lots of quantitative biological data like this makes it easier to accept the diagnosis that this is a real, physical condition. Sleep stats are also a simple, objective, and near-real time indicator for state of mind. Other data like journaling, mood tracking, emails, and finances reveal the symptoms, but that data is sparse, subjective, and laggy.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm hopeful that wearable makers might crack the code for measuring other key indicators, like anxiety and social activity data, which could also be very helpful for people with mental health issues.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Of course, the holy grail would probably be actual images of the brain over time. Perhaps when industrious scientists and engineers improve MRI and fMRI technology enough, getting a brain scan done a few times a year could really help people with bipolar understand their brains more and take better control of their condition. A new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201773">study published in Nature in May of 2017</a> provides tantalizing evidence that brain MRI scans will help us understand more how bipolar brains are different. I know I have to accept that my brain has some biological aberrations that make me more likely to behave in ways I'd rather not — but it's hard to accept that when you can't see what those aberrations are, and when the treatments are a lot of guesswork.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Wearables for Bipolar Disorder</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Monitoring sleep alone won't be the secret to a stable, productive, happy life. But it might reduce future manias. As far as I can remember, I never had a manic period without an accompanying need to sleep less. That seems to be the common experience, from what I've read. I would suggest to younger folks in high school and college who have been recently diagnosed with bipolar to get a sleep tracker and stay on it. Hopefully you'll be able to prevent some manic episodes. And if, like many others with bipolar disorder, you continue to have swings over the decades ahead, at least you'll gather data that could help you and other people figure this thing out.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Of course, technology might also be making bipolar disorder worse in those prone to it. The technology advanced <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2011/international-impact-of-bipolar-disorder-highlights-need-for-recognition-and-better-treatment-availability.shtml">U.S. has the highest rate of bipolar disorder in the world</a>. Perhaps increased screen time, less social time, or more media exacerbates the problem. But that's why I like passive wearables, which collect data without intruding on your life. Even if some innovations of the modern world offer new challenges to bipolar sufferers, some innovations also offers new hope.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Conclusion</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I wish my longest stable streak was still going strong. I wish I hadn't gone manic and then crashed into the inevitable depression.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I'm grateful that this time I was wearing a figurative “black box.” Hopefully others can learn from my experience.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Next time I start acting on a grand idea, I hope my band and I will do the healthy thing: get some sleep and forget it.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 21, 2017 — </span><strong>Eureka!</strong> I wanted to announce something small, but slightly novel, and potentially useful.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What did I discover? That there might be useful general purpose programming languages that don't use any visible syntax characters at all.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I call the whitespace-based notation <a href="https://treenotation.org">Tree Notation</a> and languages built on top of it Tree Languages.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Using a few simple atomic ingredients---words, spaces, newlines, and indentation--you can construct grammars for new programming languages that can do anything existing programming languages can do. A simple example:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">if true
 print Hello world</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This language has no parentheses, quotation marks, colons, and so forth. Types, primitives, control flow--all of that stuff can be determined by words and contexts instead of introducing additional syntax rules. If you are a Lisper, think of this "novel" idea as just "lisp without parentheses."</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="3dprogram.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="3dprogram.png" width="322" height="411" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There are hundreds of very active programming languages, and they all have different syntax as well as different semantics.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think there will always be a need for new semantic ideas. The world's knowledge domains are enormously complex (read: billions/trillions of concepts, if not more), machines are complex (billions of pieces), and both will always continue to get more complex.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I wonder if we always need a new syntax for each new general purpose programming language. I wonder if we could unlock potentially very different editing environments and experiences with a simple geometric syntax, and if by making the syntax simpler folks could build better semantic tooling.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Maybe there's nothing useful here. Perhaps it is best to have syntax characters and a unique syntax for each general purpose programming language. Tree Notation might be a bad idea or only useful for very small domains. But I think it's a long-shot idea worth exploring.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Thousands of language designers focus on the semantics and choose the syntax to best fit those semantics (or a syntax that doesn't deviate too much from a mainstream language). I've taken the opposite approach--on purpose--with the hopes of finding something overlooked but important. I've stuck to a simple syntax and tried to implement all semantic ideas without adding syntax.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Initially I just looked at Tree Notation as an alternative to declarative format languages like JSON and XML, but then in a minor "Eureka!" moment, realized it might work well as a syntax for general purpose Turing complete languages across all paradigms like functional, object-oriented, logic, dataflow, et cetera.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Someday I hope to have data definitively showing that Tree Notation is useful, or alternatively, to explain why it is suboptimal and why we need more complex syntax.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I always wanted to try my hand at writing an academic paper. So I put the announcement in a 2-page paper on GitHub and arxiv. The paper is titled <a href="https://github.com/treenotation/research/blob/master/papers/paper/treenotation.pdf">Tree Notation: an antifragile program notation</a>. I've since been informed that I should stick to writing blog posts and code and not academic papers, which is probably good advice :).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Two updates on 12/30/2017. After I wrote this I was informed that one other person from the Scheme world created <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html">a very similar notation</a> years ago. Very little was written in it, which I guess is evidence that the notation itself isn't that useful, or perhaps that there is still something missing before it catches on. The second note is I updated the wording of this post as the original was a bit rushed.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<p class="scrollParagraph">You can then easily differentiate problems. Some companies are dealing with 12 Data, some companies are dealing with 15 Data. No company is yet dealing with 19 Data. Big Data starts at 12 Data, and maybe over time you could say Big Data starts at 13 Data, et cetera.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What do you think?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This occurred to me recently as I just started following <a href="http://www.quora.com/Big-Data">Big Data on Quora</a> and was surprised to see the term used so loosely, when data is something so easily measurable. For example, a <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation">2011 Big Data report from McKinsey</a> defined big data as ranging "from a few dozen terabytes to multiple petabytes (thousands of terabytes)." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Wikipedia defines Big Data</a> as "a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">September 23, 2013 — </span>Making websites is slow and frustrating.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I met a young entrepreneur who wanted to create a website for his bed and breakfast. He had spent dozens of hours with different tools and was no closer to having what he wanted.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I met a teacher who wanted his students to turn in web pages for homework instead of paper pages. No existing tool allows his students to  easily create pages without restricting their creativity.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I met an artist who wanted a website with a slideshow for her portfolio.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A restaurant owner who wanted a website that could take online orders.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">An author who wanted a website with a blog.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A saleswoman who wanted to build a members-only site for great deals she gathered.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A candidate who wanted a website that could coordinate his volunteers.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A nonprofit founder who wanted a website that told the story of impoverished children in his country and accepted donations.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">These are just a handful of real people with real ideas who are frustrated by the current tools.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The problem</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The fact is, people want to do millions of different things  with their websites, but the only two options are to use a tool that limits your creative potential or to program your site from scratch. Neither option is ideal.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">Which is why we're building a third option. We are building an open source, general purpose IDE for building websites.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">April 2, 2013 — </span>For me, the primary motivation for creating software is to save myself and other people time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I want to spend less time doing monotonous tasks. Less time doing bureaucratic things. Less time dealing with unnecessary complexity. Less time doing chores.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I want to spend more time engaged with life.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Saving people time is perhaps the only universal good. Everyone wants to have more options with their time. Everyone benefits when a person has more time. They can enjoy that extra time and/or invest some of it to make the world better for everyone else.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Nature loves to promote inequality, but a fascinating feature of time is that it is so equally distributed. Nature took the same amount of time to evolve all of us alive today. All of our evolutionary paths are equally long. We also have equal amounts of time to enjoy life, despite the fact that other things may be very unequally distributed.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The very first program I made was meant to save me and my family time. Back in 1996, to start our computer, connect to the Internet and launch Netscape took about 20 minutes, and you had to do each step sequentially. My first BAT script automated that to allow you to turn the computer on and go play outside for 20 minutes while it connected to the web. Many years later, my ultimate motivation to save people time has remained constant.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 30, 2013 — </span>Why does it take 10,000 hours to become a master of something, and not 1,000 hours or 100,000 hours?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The answer is simple. Once you've spent 10,000 hours practicing something, no one can crush you like a bug.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let me explain. First, the most important thing to keep in mind is that nature loves inequality. For example, humans and bugs are not even close to equal in size. Humans are 1,000x bigger than bugs. It is very easy for a human to squash a bug.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, when you are starting to learn something and have spent say, 100 hours practicing that thing, you, my friend, are the bug. There are many people out there who have been practicing that thing for 10,000 hours, and can easily crush you like a bug, if they are mean spirited like that.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Once you've got 1,000 hours of practice under your belt, it becomes very hard for someone to crush you.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You reach 10,000 hours of practice, and you are now at a level where no one can possibly crush you like a bug. It is near impossible for a human to practice something for 100,000 hours. That would be 40 hours of practice per week for fifty years! Life is too chaotic, and our bodies are too fragile, to hit that level of practice. Thus, when you hit 10,000 hours, you're safe. You no longer have to wonder if there's someone out there who knows 10x more than you. You are now a master.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Do you hear them talking of genius, Degna? There is no such thing. Genius, if you like to call it that, is the gift of work continously applied. That's all it is, as I have proved for myself.

<p class="scrollParagraph">Likewise, a programmer types <code>name = Breck</code> or <code>age=15</code> hundreds of times before grasping the concept of a <em>variable</em>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What do you call it when someone finally sees the <em>concept</em>?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">John Calcote, a programmer with decades of experience, calls it a <strong>minor epiphany</strong>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Minor epiphanies. Anyone who's programmed for a while can appreciate that term.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you start programming you do pure trial and error. <em>What will happen when I type this or click that?</em> You rely on memorization of action and reaction. Nothing makes sense. Every single term--variable, object, register, boolean, int, string, array, and so on--is completely and utterly foreign.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But you start to encounter these moments. These minor epiphanies, where suddenly you see the connection between a class of things. Suddenly something makes sense. Suddenly one term is not so foreign anymore. You have a new tool at your disposable. You have removed another obstacle that used to trip you.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In programming the well of minor epiphanies never runs dry. Even after you've learned thousands of things the epiphanies keep flowing at the same rate. Maybe the epiphanies are no longer about <em>what</em> the concept is, or <em>how</em> you can use it, but now are more about <em>where</em> did this concept come from, <em>when</em> was it created, <em>who</em> created it, and most fascinating of all, <em>why did they create it</em>?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Minor epiphanies give you a rush, save you time, help you make better products, and help you earn more.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">The problem is the opportunity cost of purchases. That opportunity cost can cost you a fortune.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">In the movie "Back to the Future II", the main character Marty, after traveling decades into the future, buys a sports alamanac so he can go back in time and make easy money betting on games.

He only had the guide to <em>one version</em>.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 22, 2012 — </span>Entrepreneurship is taking responsibility for a problem you did not create.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It was not Google's fault that the web was a massive set of unorganized pages that were hard to search, but they claimed responsibility for the problem and solved it with their engine.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It was not Dropbox's fault that data loss was common and sharing files was a pain, but they claimed  responsibility for the problem and solved it with their software.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It is not Tesla's fault that hundreds of millions of cars are burning gasoline and polluting our atmosphere, but they have claimed responsibility for the problem and are attempting to solve it with their electric cars.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In a free market, like in America or online, you can attempt to take responsibility for any problem you want. That's pretty neat. You can decide to take responsibility for making sure your neighborhood has easy access to great Mexican food. Or you can decide to take responsibility for making sure the whole Internet has easy access to reliable version control. If you do a good job, you will be rewarded based on how big the problem is and how well you solve it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How big an entrepreneur's company gets is strongly correlated with how much responsibility the entrepreneur wants. The entrepreneur gets to constantly make choices about whether they want their company to take on more and more responsibility. Companies only get huge because their founders say "yes" to more and more responsibility. Oftentimes they can say "yes" to less responsibility, and sell their company or fold it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Walmart started out as a discount store in the Midwest, but Sam Walton (and his successors) constantly said "yes" to more and more responsibility and Walmart has since grown to take on responibility for discounting across the world.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Google started out with just search, but look at all the other things they've decided to take responsibility for: email, mobile operating systems, web browsers, social networking, document creation, calendars, and so on. Their founders have said "yes" to more and more responsibility.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Smart entrepreneurship is all about choosing problems you can and want to own. You need to say "no" to most problems. If you say "yes" to everything, you'll stretch yourself too thin. You need to increase your responsibility in a realistic way. You need to focus hard on the problems you can solve with your current resources, and leave the other problems for another company or another time.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 19, 2012 — </span>For the past year I've been raving about Node.js, so I cracked a huge smile when I saw this question on Quora:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">In five years, which language is likely to be most prominent, Node.js, Python, or Ruby, and why?
- <a href="http://www.quora.com/In-five-years-which-language-is-likely-to-be-most-prominent-Node-js-Python-or-Ruby-and-why">Quora</a></blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For months I had been repeating the same answer to friends: "Node.js hands down. If you want to build great web apps, you don't have a choice, you have to master Javascript. Why then master two languages when you don't need to?"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Javascript+Node.js is to Python and Ruby what the iPhone is to MP3 players--it has made them redundant. You don't need them anymore.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So I started writing this out and expanding upon it. As I'm doing this, a little voice in my head was telling me something wasn't right. And then I realized: despite reading Taleb's books every year, I was making the exact mistake he warns about. I was predicting the future without remembering that the future is dominated not by the predictable, but by the unpredictable, the Black Swans.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And sure enough, as soon as I started to imagine some Black Swans, I grew less confident in my prediction. I realized all it would take would be for one or two browser vendors to start supporting Python or Ruby or language X in the browser to potentially disrupt Node.js' major advantage. I don't think that's likely, but it's the type of low probability event that could have a huge impact.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When I started to think about it, I realized it was quite easy to imagine Black Swans. Imagine visiting hackernews in 2013 and seeing any one of these headlines:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Microsoft Open Sources Windows.</li>
<li >Researchers Crack SSL. Render it useless.</li>
<li >Google Perfects Voice Recognition.</li>
<li >Facebook Covers the World in Free Wifi.</li>
<li >Amazon Launches Distributed Data Centers in your home.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It took only a few minutes to imagine a few of these things. Clearly there are hundreds of thousands of low probability events that could come from established companies or startups that could shift the whole industry.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The future is impossible to predict accurately.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>All that being said, Node.js kicks ass <strong>today</strong>(the Javascript thing, the community, the speed, the packages, the fact I don't need a separate web server anymore...it is awesome), and I would not be surprised if Javascript becomes 10-100x bigger in the years ahead, while I can't say the same about other languages. And if Javascript doesn't become that big, worst case is it's still a very powerful language and you'll benefit a lot from focusing on it.</em></p>

<blockquote class="scrollQuote">There's a man in the world who is never turned down, wherever he chances to stray;
he gets the glad hand in the populous town, or out where the farmers make hay;
he's greeted with pleasure on deserts of sand, and deep in the aisles of the woods;
wherever he goes there's the welcoming hand--he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods.

The failures of life sit around and complain; the gods haven't treated them white;
they've lost their umbrellas whenever there's rain, and they haven't their lanterns at night;
men tire of the failures who fill with their sighs the air of their own neighborhoods;
there's one who is greeted with love-lighted eyes--he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods.

One fellow is lazy, and watches the clock, and waits for the whistle to blow;
and one has a hammer, with which he will knock, and one tells a story of woe;
and one, if requested to travel a mile, will measure the perches and roods;
but one does his stunt with a whistle or smile--he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods.

One man is afraid that he'll labor too hard--the world isn't yearning for such;
and one man is always alert, on his guard, lest he put in a minute too much;
and one has a grouch or a temper that's bad, and one is a creature of moods;
so it's hey for the joyous and rollicking lad--for the One Who Delivers the Goods!

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 18, 2012 — </span>One of Nassim Taleb's big recommendations for how to live in an uncertain world is to follow a barbell strategy: be extremely conservative about most decisions, but make some decisions that open you up to uncapped upside.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In other words, put 90% of your time into safe, conservative things but take some risks with the other 10%.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I personally try to follow this advice, particularly with our startup. I think it is good advice. I think it would be swell if our company became a big, profitable, innovation machine someday. But that's not what keeps me up at night.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm more concerned about creating the best worst case scenario. I spend most of my time trying to improve the worst case outcomes. Specifically, here's how I think you do this:</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Tackle a big problem</strong>. Worst case scenario is you don't completely solve it, but you learn a lot in that domain and get aquired/acquihired by a bigger company in the space. That's a great outcome.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Build stuff you want</strong>. Worst case scenario is no one uses your product but you. If you aren't a fan of what you build, then you have nothing. If you love your product, that's a great outcome.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Focus on your customers</strong>. Make sure your customers are happy and getting what they want. Worst case scenario, you made a couple people of people happy. That's a great outcome.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Practice your skills</strong>. Worst case scenario is the company doesn't work out, but you are now much better at what you do. That's a great outcome.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Deliver</strong>. Worst case scenario is you deliver something that isn't quite perfect but is good and helps people. That's a great outcome.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Avoid debt</strong>. If you take on debt or raise money, worst case scenario is you run out of time and you lose control of your destiny. If you keep money coming in, worst case scenario is things take a little longer or if you move on you are not in a hole. That's a great outcome.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Enjoy life</strong>. Make sure you take time to enjoy life. Worst case scenario is you spend a few years with no great outcome at work but you have many great memories from life. That's a great outcome.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then, if you want to make yourself open to positive black swans, you can put 10% of your efforts into things that make you more open to those like: recruiting world class talent, pitching and raising money, tackling bigger markets. But make sure you focus on the conservative things. Risk, in moderation, is a good thing. Risk, in significant amounts, is for the foolish.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 18, 2012 — </span>My whole life I've been trying to understand how the world works. How do planes fly? How do computers compute? How does the economy coordinate?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Over time I realized that these questions are all different ways of asking the same thing: how do complex systems work?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The past few years I've had the opportunity to spend thousands of hours practicing programming and studying computers. I now understand, in depth, one complex system. I feel I can finally answer the general question about complex systems with a very simple answer.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Compounded Probability Makes Complex Systems Work</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There is no certainty in life or in systems, but there is probability, and probability compounds.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We can combine the high probability that wheels roll, with the high probability that wood supports loads, to build a wooden chariot that has a high probability of carrying things from point A to point B, which has a high probability of giving us more time to innovate, and so on and so forth...</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Everything is built off of probability. You are reading this because of countless compounded probabilities like:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >There is a high probability that your Internet connection works</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my web server is responding to connections</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my web server's disk works</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my web software works and will handle this post</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my Internet connection works</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my text editor won't fail as I write this</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my laptop works</li>
<li >There is a high probability that the CPU in my laptop consistently adds numbers in the registers correctly</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Complex systems consist of many, many simple components with understood probabilities stitched together.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How does a plane fly? The most concise and accurate answer isn't about aerodynamics or lift, it's about probabilities. A plane is simply a huge system of compounded probabilities.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How does a bridge stay up? The answer is not about physics, it's about compounded probabilities.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How do computers work? Compounded probability.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How do cars work? Compounded probability.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The economy? Compounded probability.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Medicine? Compounded probability.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's probability all the way down.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 16, 2012 — </span>When I was a kid I loved reading the Family Circus. My favorite strips were the "dotted lines" ones, which showed Billy's movements over time:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/0.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/0.png" width="1200" height="584" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">These strips gave a clear narrative of Billy's day. In the strip above, Billy, a fun loving kid, was given a task by his mother to put some letters in the mailbox before the mailman arrives. Billy took the letters, ran into the kitchen, then dashed into the living room, jumped on the couch, sprinted to the dining room, crawled under the dining room table, skipped into the TV room, jumped into the crib, twirled into the foyer, stumbled outside, swung around the light post, then ran to the mailbox.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We know the end result: Billy failed to get to the mailbox in time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">With this picture in mind, let's do a thought experiment.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's imagine that right now, once again, Billy and his mom are standing in the laundry room and she's about to give him the mail. What are the odds that Billy gets to the mailbox in time?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Pick a range, and then <a onclick="document.getElementById('answer').style.display='block'" style="color:blue; cursor: pointer;">click here</a> to see the answer.</p>
<div style="display: none;" id="answer">
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you answered: "somewhere between 0 and 100%" you were correct! If your answer was any more precise than that, you were wrong. Given only the single narrative above, you would have no basis for being more confident than a random guess between 0 and 1.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But, if you're like me, it would be hard to resist making a more precise guess based upon the story we saw. Humans, at least many of us, are quick to build narratives around events and then rely on those narratives to make predictions.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We know what happened before, so we try to predict the future off of that. This wouldn't be a problem if we truly knew what happened before. The problem is: we don't actually know what happened before. We only know what we witnessed before. <em>A lot happened that we didn't witness</em>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The problem is we only get to witness one universe, one path, but nature in fact, is constantly generating many, many paths. What we witnessed is not the whole story. What we witnessed is just a slice of the story.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Words might not be the best way to explain this. Let's draw it out.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm going to redraw the strip above to show you more of the story. More of what actually happened. Because I suck at drawing, my first step will be to simplify the strip a bit. Here is my simplified Family Circus house:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/1.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/1.png" width="2199" height="765" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And here is the path in the actual comic redrawn in my version:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/2.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/2.png" width="2198" height="772" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, my assumption, based on the hunch that the multiverse theory of the world is correct, is that the universe is constantly branching, and so, somewhere out there, Billy took a direct path to the mailbox:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/3.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/3.png" width="2200" height="776" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There's proably also a universe where he took a direct route but also took a minute to watch some TV:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/4.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/4.png" width="2200" height="744" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And there's a universe where he took the same winding route as in the original, except without the trip to the dining room:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/5.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/5.png" width="2200" height="736" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A universe where he took an even longer route than the original:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/6.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/6.png" width="2200" height="766" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And maybe a universe where he snuck out the back door and took a real quick route:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/7.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/7.png" width="2200" height="852" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Finally, perhaps there was a universe where he refused his mother's order and didn't go to the mailbox at all:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/8.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/8.png" width="2200" height="777" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, although this is still just a sliver of what actually happened, it is a lot more realistic picture of what happened than just having the original, which does not tell us what happened, but just what we witnessed.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It is easy to build a narrative off of what we witnessed. But that is the problem.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Predicting what is going to happen in the future requires us understanding what happened in the past.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We can combine all of the paths above to get a more realistic look at what happened in the past:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="family_circus/9.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="family_circus/9.png" width="2200" height="776" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You cannot build much of a narrative out of that. When you look honestly at nature, you cannot create a narrative. As Taleb would say, nature is what it is, it does not need a narrative.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The bottom line is, beware of narratives. Don't make predictions based off narratives.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Experiments, where we get to witness thousands or millions of universes are good for instruction, for prediction. But narratives are for entertainment.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">(Influenced a lot by Taleb's new book, Antifragile.)</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">In 1998, a large group of developers were working on technologies to make the web simpler, more collaborative, and more powerful. Their vision and hard work led to XML and SOAP.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">These technologies allowed developers across the world to build websites that could work together with other websites in interesting ways. Nowadays, most web companies have APIs, but that wasn't always the case.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Although XML and SOAP were a big leap forward, in practice they are difficult to use. It's arguable whether they are truly "human-readable" or "simple".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Luckily, in 2001 Douglas Crockford specified a simpler, more concise language called <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>. Today JSON has become the de facto language for web services.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Could JSON be improved?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Early last year, one idea that struck me was that subtle improvements to underlying technologies can have exponential impact. Fix a bug in subversion and save someone hours of effort, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">replace subversion</a> and save someone weeks.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The switch from XML to JSON had made my life so much easier, I wondered if you could extract an even simpler alternative to JSON. JSON, while simple, still takes a while to learn, particularly if you are new to coding. Although more concise than XML, JSON has at present six types and eight syntax characters, all of which can easily derail developers of all skill levels. Because whitespace is insignificant in JSON, it quickly becomes messy. These are all relatively small details, but I think perhaps getting the details right in a new encoding could make a big difference in developers' lives.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Introducing Note</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After almost two years of tinkering, and with a lot of inspiration from JSON, XML, HAML, Python, YAML, and other languages, we have a new simple encoding that I hope might make it easier for people to create and use web services.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We dubbed the encoding Note, and have put an early version with Javascript support up on <a href="https://github.com/breck7/note">Github</a>. We've also put out a quick demonstration site that allows you to interact with some popular APIs using Note.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Note is a text based encoding that uses whitespace to give your data structure. Note is simple: there are only two syntax characters (newline and space). It is concise--not a single keystroke is wasted (we use a single space for indentation--why use 2 when one is sufficient?). Note is neat: the meaningful whitespace forces adherance to a clean style. These features make Note very easy to read and to write.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Despite all this minimalism, Note is very powerful. Each note is a hash consisting of name/value pairs. Note is also recursive, so each note can be a tree containing other notes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Note has only two types: strings and notes. Every entity in note is either a string or another Note. But Note is infinitely extendable. You can create domain specific languages on top of Note that support additional types as long as you respect the whitespace syntax of Note.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This is a very brief overview of the thinking behind Note and some of its features. I look forward to the months ahead as we start to implement Note on sites across the web and demonstrate some of the neat features and capabilities of the encoding.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">November 26, 2012 — </span>For todo lists, I created a system I call planets and pebbles.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="planets_and_pebbles.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="planets_and_pebbles.png" width="477" height="256" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I label each task as a planet or a pebble. Planets are super important things. It could be helping a customer complete their project, meeting a new person, finishing an important new feature, closing a new sale, or helping a friend in need. I may have 20 pebbles that I fail to do, but completing one planet makes up for all that and more.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I let the pebbles build up, and I chip away at them in the off hours. But the bulk of my day I try to focus on the planets--the small number of things that can have exponential impact. I don't sweat the small stuff.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I highly recommend this system. We live in a power law world, and it's important to practice the skill of predicting what things will prove hugely important, and what things will turn out to be pebbles.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">November 25, 2012 — </span>I published 55 essays here the first year. The second and third years combined, that number nosedived to 5.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What caused me to stop publishing?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It hasn't been a lack of ideas. All my essays start with a note to self. I have just as many notes to self nowadays as I did back then.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It hasn't been a lack of time. I have been working more but blogging doesn't take much time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's partly to do with standards. I've been trying to make higher quality things. I used to just write for an hour or two and hit publish. Now I'm more picky.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've also become somewhat disappointed with the essay form. I am very interested in understanding systems, and I feel words alone don't explain systems well. So I've been practicing my visual and design skills. But I'm basically a beginner and output is slow.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The bottom line is I want to publish more. It forces me to think hard about my opinions, and it opens me up to advice from other people. I think this blog has helped me be less wrong about a lot of things. So here's to another fifty posts.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="setplicity.html">Setplicity</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">November 20, 2012 — </span>"Is simplicity ever bad?" If you had asked me this a year ago, I probably would have called you a fucking moron for asking such a dumb question. "Never!", I would have shouted. Now, I think it's a fair question. Simplicity has it's limits. Simplicity is not enough, and if you pursue simplicity at all costs, that can be a bad thing. There's something more than simplicity that you need to be aware of. I'll get to that in a second, but first, I want to backtrack a bit and state clearly that I do strongly, strongly believe and strive for simplicity. Let me talk about why for a second.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Why I love simplicity</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Simple products are pleasant to use. When I use a product, and it is easy to use, and it's quick to use, I love that. I fucking hate things that are not as simple as possible and waste people's time or mental energy as a result. For example, to file my taxes with the IRS, I cannot go to the IRS' website. It's much more complex than that. I hate that. It is painful. Complex things are painful to use. Simple things are pleasant to use. They make life better. This is, of course, well known to all good designers and engineers.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Simple things are also more democratic. When I can understand something, I feel smart. I feel empowered. When I cannot understand something, I feel stupid. I feel inferior. Complex things are hard to understand. The response shouldn't be to spend a long time learning the complex thing, it should be to figure out how to make the complex thing simpler. When you do that, you create a lot of value. If I can understand something, I can do something. When we make things simpler, we empower people. Often times I wonder if being a doctor would only take 2 years if Medicine abandoned Latin terms for a simpler vocabulary.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Reaching the Limits of Simplicity</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This whole year, and well before that, I've been working with people trying to make the web simpler. The web is really complex. You need to know about HTML, CSS, Javascript, DNS, HTTP, DOM, Command Line, Linux, Web Servers, Databases, and so on. It's a fucking mess. It's fragmented to all hell as well. Everyone is using different languages, tools, and platforms. It can be a pain.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Anyway, we've been trying to make a simple product. And we've been trying to balance simplicity with features. And that's been difficult. Way more difficult than I would have predicted.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The thing is, simpler is not always better. A fork is simpler than a fork, knife, and spoon, but which would you rather have? The set is better. Great things are built by combining distinct, simple things together. If you took away the spoon, you'd make the set simpler, but not better. Which reminds me of that Einstein quote:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I had always been focused on the first part of that quote. Make things as simple as possible. Lately I've thought more about the second part. Sometimes by trying to make things too simple you make something a lot worse. Often, less is more, but less can definitely be less.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People rave about the simplicity of the iPhone. And it is simple, in a sense. But it is also very complex. It has a large screen, 2 cameras, a wifi antenna, a GPS, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a cell antenna, a gpu, cpus, memory, a power unit, 2 volume buttons, a power button, a home button, a SIM card slot, a mode switch, and a whole lot more. Then the software inside is another massive layer of complexity. You could try to make the iPhone simpler by, for example, removing the volume buttons or the cameras, but that, while increasing the simplicity, would decrease the "setplicity". It would remove a very helpful part of the set which would make the whole product worse.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Think about what the world would be like if we only used half of the periodic table of elements--it would be less beautiful, less enjoyable, and more painful.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Simplicity is a great thing to strive for. But sometimes cutting things out to make something simpler can make it worse. Simplicity is not the only thing to maximize. Make sure to balance simplicity with setplicity. Don't worry if you haven't reduced things to a singularity. Happiness in life is found by balancing amongst a set of things, not by cutting everything out.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="naming-things.html">Naming Things</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">October 20, 2012 — </span>I love to name things.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I spend a lot of time naming ideas in my work. At work I write my code using a program called TextMate. TextMate is a great little program with a pleasant purple theme. I spend a lot of time using TextMate. For the past year I've been using TextMate to write a program that now consists of a few hundred files. There are thousands of words in this program. There are hundreds of objects and concepts and functions that each have a name. The names are super simple like "Pen" for an object that draws on the screen, and "delete" for a method that deletes something. Some of the things in our program are more important than others and those really important ones I've renamed dozens of times searching for the right fit.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There's a feature in TextMate that lets me find and replace a word across all 400+ files in the project. If I am unhappy with my word choice for a variable or concept, I'll think about it for weeks if not months. I'll use Thesaurus.com, I'll read about similar concepts, I'll run a subconscious search for the simplest, best word. When I find it, I'll hit Command+Shift+F in TextMate and excitedly and carefully execute a find and replace across the whole project. Those are some of my favorite programming days--when I find a better name for an important part of the program.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Naming a thing is like creating life from inorganic material in a lab. You observe some pattern, combine a bunch of letters to form a name, and then see what happens. Sometimes your name doesn't fit and sits lifeless. But sometimes the name is just right. You use it in conversation or in code and people instantly get it. It catches on. It leaves the lab. Your name takes a life of its own and spreads.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Words are very contagious. The better the word, the more contagious it can be. Like viruses, small differences in the quality of a word can have exponential differences on it's spread.  So I like to spend time searching for the right words.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Great names are short. Short names are less effort to communicate. The quality of a name drops exponentially with each syllable you add. Coke is better than Coca-Cola. Human is better than homo sapiens.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Great names are visual. A good test of whether a name is accurate is whether you can draw a picture of the name that makes sense. Net is better than cyberspace. If you drew a picture of the physical components of the Internet, it would look a lot like a fishing net. Net is a great name.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Great names are used for great ideas. You should match the quality of a name to the quality of the idea compared to the other ideas in the space. This is particularly applicable in the digital world. If you are working on an important idea that will be used by a lot of people in a broad area, use a short, high quality name. If you are working on a smaller idea in that same area, don't hog a better name than your idea deserves. Linux is filled with great programs with bad names and bad programs with great names. I've been very happy so far with my experience with NPM, where it seems programmers who are using the best names are making their programs live up to them.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think the exercise of naming things can be very helpful in improving things. Designing things from first principles is a proven way to arrive at novel, sometimes better ideas. Attempting to rename something is a great way to rethink the thing from the ground up.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For example, lately I've been trying to come up with a way to explain the fundamentals of computing. A strategy I recently employed was to change the names we use for the 2 boolean states from True and False to Absent or Present. It seems like it gets closer to the truth of how computers work. I mean, it doesn't make sense to ask a bit whether it is True or False. The only question an electronic bit can answer is whether a charge is present or absent. When we compare variable A to variable B, the CPU sets a flag in the comparison bit and we are really asking that bit whether a charge is present.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What I like about the idea of using the names Present and Absent is that it makes the fundamentals of computing align with the fundamentals of the world. The most fundamental questions in the world about being--of existence. Do we exist? Why do we exist? Will we exist tomorrow? Likewise, the most fundamental questions in computing is not whether or not there are ones and zeroes, it's whether or not a charge exists. Does a charge exist? Why does that charge exist? Will that charge exist in the next iteration? Computing is not about manipulating ones and zeroes. It's about using the concept of being, of existence, to solve problems. Computing is about using the concept of the presence or absence of charge to do many wonderful things. </p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="what-can-a-programmer-learn-from-rock-climbing.html">What can a Programmer learn from Rock Climbing?</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 30, 2011 — </span>Railay is a tiny little beach town in Southern Thailand famous for its rock climbing. I've been in Railay for two weeks. When the weather is good, I'm outside rock climbing. When the weather is bad, I'm inside programming. So naturally I've found myself comparing the two. Specifically I've been thinking about what I can take away from my rock climbing experience and apply to my programming education.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here's what I've come up with.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">1. <strong>You should always be pushing yourself.</strong> Each day spent climbing I've made it to a slightly higher level than the previous day. The lazy part of me has then wanted to just spend one day enjoying this new level without pushing myself further. Luckily I've had a great climbing partner who's refused that and has forced me to reach for the next level each day. In both rock climbing and programming you should always be reaching for that new level. It's not easy, you have to risk a fall to reach a new height, but it's necessary if you want to become good. In programming, just like in climbing, you should be tagging along with the climbers at levels above you. That's how you get great. Of course, don't forget to enjoy the moment too.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">2. <strong><em>Really</em> push yourself.</strong> In rock climbing you sometimes have these points where you're scared--no, where you're <em>fucking petrified</em>--that you're going to fall and get hurt or die and you're hanging on to the rock for dear life, pouring sweat, and you've got to overcome it. In programming you should <em>seek out moments like these</em>. It will never be that extreme of course, but you should find those spots where you are afraid of falling and push yourself to conquer them. It might be a project whose scope is way beyond anything you've attempted before, or a task that requires advanced math, or a language that scares the crap out of you. My climbing instructor here was this Thai guy named Nu. He's the second best speed climber in Thailand and has been climbing for fifteen years. The other day I was walking by a climbing area and saw Nu banging his chest and yelling at the top of his lungs. I asked a bystander what was going on and he told me that Nu was struggling with the crux of a route and was psyching himself up to overcome it. That's why he's a master climber. Because he's been climbing for over fifteen years and he's <em>still seeking out those challenges that scare him</em>. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">3. <strong>There's always a next level.</strong> In rock climbing you have clearly defined levels of difficulty that you progress through such as 5 to 8+ or top rope to lead+. In programming the levels are less defined and span a much wider range but surely exist. You progress from writing "hello world" to writing compilers and from using notepad to using vim or textmate or powerful IDEs. You might start out writing a playlist generator and ten years later you may be writing a program that can generate actual symphonies, but there still will be levels to climb.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">4. <strong>Climbing or programming without teachers is very inefficient.</strong> There are plenty of books on rock climbing. But there's no substitute for great teachers. You can copy what you see in books and oftentimes you'll get many parts right, but a teacher is great for pointing out what you're doing wrong. Oftentimes you just can't tell what the key concepts and techniques to focus on are. You might not focus on something that's really important such as using mostly legs in climbing or not repeating yourself in programming. A good teacher can instantly see your mistakes and provide helpful feedback. Always seek out great teachers and mentors whether they be friends, coworkers, or professional educators.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">5. <strong>You learn by doing; practice is key.</strong> Although you need teachers and books to tell you what to do, the only way to learn is to do it yourself, over and over. It takes a ton of time to master rock climbing or programming and although receiving instruction plays an important part, the vast majority of the time it takes to learn will be spent practicing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">6. <strong>Breadth, not only depth, is important</strong>. Sometimes to get to the next level in rock climbing you need to get outside of rock climbing. You may need to take up yoga to gain flexibility or weightlifting to gain strength. Likewise in programming sometimes you need to go sideways to go up. If you want to master Rails, you'll probably want to spend time outside of it and work on your command line and version control skills. Programming has a huge amount of silos. To go very deep in any one you have to gain competance in many.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">7. <strong>People push the boundaries.</strong> Both rock climbing and programming were discovered by people and people are continually pushing the boundaries of both. In rock climbing advanced climbers are discovering new areas, bolting new routes, inventing new equipment, perfecting new techniques, and passing down new knowledge. Programming is the most cumulative of all human endeavors. It builds on the work of tens of millions of people and new "risk takers" are always constantly pushing the frontiers (today in areas like distributed computing, data mining, machine learning, parallel processing and mobile amongst others).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">8. <strong>Embrace collaboration.</strong> The rock climbing culture is very collaborative much like the open source culture. Rock climbing is an inherently open source activity. Everything a climber does and uses is visible in the open. This leads to faster knowledge transfer and a safer activity. Likewise, IMO open source software leads to a better outcome for all.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">9. <strong>Take pride in your work.</strong> In rock climbing when you're the first to ascend a route your name gets forever attached to that route. In programming you should be proud of your work and add your name to it. Sometimes I get embarrassed when I look at some old code of mine and realize how bad it is. But then I shrug it off because although it may be bad by my current standards, it represents my best honest effort at the time and so there's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm sure the world's greatest rock climbers have struggled with some easy routes in their day.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">10. <strong>Natural gifts play a part.</strong> Some people who practiced for 5,000 hours will be worse than some people who practiced for only 2,000 hours due to genetics and other factors. It would be great if how good you were at something was determined totally by how many hours you've invested. But it's not. However, at the extremes, the number of hours of practice makes a huge difference. The absolute best climbers spend an enormous amount of time practicing. In the middle of the pack, a lot of the difference is just due to luck. I've worked with a wide range of programmers in my (short so far) career. I've worked with really smart ones and some average ones. Some work hard and others aren't so dedicated. The best by far though, possess both the intelligence and the dedication. And I'd probably rather work with the dedicated and average smarts over the brilliant but lazy.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="look-for-a-line.html">Look for a Line</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 5, 2011 — </span>A good friend passed along some business advice to me a few months ago. "Look for a line," he said. Basically, if you see a line out the door at McDonald's, start Burger King. Lines are everywhere and are dead giveaways for good business ideas and good businesses.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's use Groupon as a case study for the importance of lines. Groupon scoured Yelp for the best businesses in its cities--the businesses that had virtual lines of people writing positive reviews--and created huge lines for these businesses with their discounts. Other entrepreneurs saw the number of people lining up to purchase things from Groupon and created a huge line of clones. Investors saw other investors lining up to buy Groupon stock and hopped in line as well. Business is all about lines.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In every country we travel to I look around for lines. It's a dead giveaway for finding good places to eat, fun things to do, amazing sites to see. If you want to start a business, look for lines and either create a clone or create an innovation that can steal customers from that line. If you see tons of people lining up to take taxis, start a taxi company. Better yet, start a bus.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Creating Lines</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Succeeding in business is all about creating lines. Apple creates lines of reporters looking to write about their next big product. Customers line up outside their doors to buy their next big product. Investors line up to pump money into AAPL. Designers and engineers line up to work there.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you are the CEO of a company, your job is simply to create lines. You want customers lining up for your product, investors lining up to invest, recruits lining up to apply for jobs. It's very easy to measure how you're doing. If you look around and don't see any lines, you gotta pick it up.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 4, 2011 — </span><em>I haven't written in a long while because i'm currently on a long trip around the world. at the moment, we're in indonesia. one thing that really surprised me was that despite our best efforts to do as little planning as possible, we were in fact almost overprepared. i've realized you can do an around the world trip with literally zero planning and be perfectly fine. you can literally hop on a plane with nothing more than a passport, license, credit card, and the clothes on your back and worry about the rest later. i think a lot of people don't make a journey like this because they're intimidated not by the trip itself, but by the planning for the trip. i'm here to say you don't need to plan at all to travel the world (alas, would be a lot harder if you were not born in a first world country, unfortunately). here's my guide for anyone that might want to attempt to do so. every step is highlighted in bold. adjust accordingly for your specific needs and desires.</em></p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The plan (see below for bullet points)</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Set a savings goal.</strong> you'll need money to travel around the world, and the more money you have, the easier, longer, and more fun your journey will be.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Save, save, save</strong>. make sure you save enough so that when your trip ends you won't come home broke. $12,000 would be a large enough amount to travel for a long time and still come back with money to get you resettled easily.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Once you've saved half of your goal, <strong>buy your first one way plane ticket to a cheap, tourist friendly country</strong>. bali, indonesia or bangkok, thailand would be terrific first stops, amongst others. next, <strong>get a paypal account with a paypal debit card</strong>. this card gives you 1.5% cash back on all purchases, only charges a $1 atm fee, and charges no foreign transaction fees at all. the 1.5% cash back more than offsets the 1% fee Mastercard charges for interchange fees. if you don't have them already, <strong>get a drivers license and a passport with at least 1 year left before expiration</strong>. <strong>get a free google voice number so people can still SMS and leave you voicemails without paying a monthly cell phone bill</strong>. if you need glasses, contacts, prescription medication, or other custom things, stock up on those.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Settle your affairs at home--housing, job, etc</strong>. now, your planning is DONE! you have everything you need to embark on a trip around the world.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Get on the plane with your passport, license, paypal debit card, and $100 US Cash</strong>. you don't need anything else--not even a backpack! you'll pick up all that later.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Once you've arrived in bali (or another similar locale), <strong>go to a large, cheap shopping district</strong>(kuta square in bali for example). if you arrived late, find a cheap place to crash first and hit the market first thing in the morning. look for backpackers at the airport or ask someone who works there for cheap accommodation recommendations.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Once you're at the market, you've got a lot to buy. <strong>visit an ATM</strong> to take money out of your PayPal account in the local currency. if you want, space out your purchases over a few days. you'll want to <strong>buy a lonely planet/rough guides for your current country, a solid backpack (get a good one), bug spray with deet, sun tan lotion,  a toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, nail clippers, tweezers, a swiss army knife, pepto bismol, tylenol, band aids, neosporin, bathing suit, some clothes for the current weather, shoes/flip flops, a cheap cell phone and SIM card, a netbook, a power adapter, and a camera and memory card</strong>. you now have pretty much everything you need for your trip and you probably spent less than half of what you would have had to spend in the states. you may want some other things like a sleeping bag, tent, portable stove, goggles, etc., depending on what you want to do on your trip.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, <strong>talk to locals and other travelers for travel recommendations</strong>. that plus your lonely planet and maybe some google searching and you'll have all the tools you need to plan where to go, what to do and what to eat.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Hit up an internet cafe to email and print a copy of your drivers license, passport, and credit card</strong>. it will be dirt cheap. <strong>get some passport photos made for countries that require a photo for visas</strong>. then <strong>sign up for skype and facebook</strong> (if you're the one person in the world who hasn't done this yet) to make cheap phone calls and keep in touch with family and friends.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Plan your trip one country at a time</strong>. every few days, <strong>check flight prices for the next few legs of your trip</strong>. you can sometimes get amazingly cheap deals if you check prices frequently and are flexible about when and where you fly. use sites like kayak, adioso, hotels.com, airbnb, and hostelworld to find cheap flights and places to stay, especially in expensive countries. in cheap countries, lonely planet and simply asking around often works great for finding great value hotels. also in expensive cities, <strong>find the local groupon clones and check them often for great excursion and meal deals</strong>. finally, you might want to get travel insurance from a site like world nomads.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="the-economy-explained.html">The Economy Explained</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">September 18, 2010 — </span>I was an Economics major in college but in hindsight I don't like the way it was taught. I came away with an academic, unrealistic view of the economy. If I had to teach economics I would try to explain it in a more realistic, practical manner.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think there are two big concepts that if you understand, you'll have a better grasp of the economy than most people. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The first idea is that the economy has a pulse and its been beating for thousands of years. The second is that the economy is like a brain and if you visualize it in that way you can make better decisions depending on your goals.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">In Media Res</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Thousands of years ago people were trading goods and service, knitting clothes, and growing crops. The economy slowly came to life probably around 20 or 15 thousand years ago and it's never stopped. Although countless kingdoms, countries, industries, companies, families, workers, owners, have come and gone, this giant invisible thing called the economy has kept on trucking.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And not much has changed.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Certainly in 2,000 B.C. there was a lot more bartering and a lot less Visa, but most of the concepts that describe today's economy are the same as back then. You had industries and specialization, rich and poor, goods and services, marketplaces and trade routes, taxes and government spending, debts and investments. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Today, the economy is more connected. It covers more of the globe. But it's still the same economy that came to life thousands of years ago. It's just grown up a bit.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What are the implications of this? I think the main thing to take away from this idea is that we live in a pretty cool time where the economy has matured for thousands of years. It has a lot to offer if we understand what it is and how to use it. Which brings me to my next point.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The economy is like a brain.</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The second big idea I try to keep in mind about the economy is that it's like a neural network. It's really hard to form a model of what the economy really looks like, but I think a great analogy is the human brain. </p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At a microscopic level, the brain is composed of around 100 billion neurons. The economy is currently composed of around 8 billion humans. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The average neuron is directly connected to 1,000 other neurons via synapses. Some neurons have more connections, some have less. The average human is directly connected to 200 other humans in their daily economic dealings. Some more, some less.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Neurons and synapes are not distributed evenly in the brain. Some are in relatively central connections, some are on the periphery. Likewise, some humans operate in critical parts of the economy(London or Japan for example), while many live in the periphery(Driggs, Idaho or Afghanistan, for example).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If we run with this analogy that the economy is like the human brain, what can we take home from that?</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">For people that want a high paying job</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you want a high paying job then you should think carefully about where you plug yourself into the network/economy. You want to plug yourself in where there's a lot of action. You want to plug yourself into a "nerve center". These nerve centers can be certain geographies, certain industries, certain companies, etc. For instance, plugging yourself into an investment banking job on Wall Street will bring you more money than teaching surfing in Maui. Now, if you're born in the periphery, like a third world nation, you might be SOL. It's tremendously easier to plug yourself into a nerve center if you're born in the right place at the right time.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">If you don't care much for money there are plenty of peripheries</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now if you don't want a high paying job there are more choices available to you. Most of the economy is not a nerve center. It's also a lot easier to move from a high paying spot in the economic brain to a place in a lower paying spot.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Starting a business you've got to inject yourself into it.</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you start a business, you're basically a neuron with no synapses living outside the brain. You've got to inject yourself into the brain and build as many synapses as possible. When you start a business, the brain("the economy"), doesn't give a shit about you. You've got to plug yourself in and make yourself needed. You've got to get other neurons(people/companies/governments) to depend on you. You can do this through a combination of hard work, great products/services, great sales, etc.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now one thing I find interesting is that a lot of people say entrepreneurs are rebels. This is sort of true, however, for a business to be successful the business has to conform a lot for the economy to build connections to it. If you want to be a nerve center, you've got to make it easy for other parts of the economy to connect to you. You can't be so different that you are incompatible with the rest of the economy. If you want to be a complete rebel, you can do that on the periphery, but you won't become a big company/nerve center.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">If you're an existing business, it's hard to get dislodged.</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Once you are "injected" into the economy, it's hard to get dislodged. If a lot of neurons have a lot of synapses connected to you, those will only die slowly. For a long time business will flow through you. This explains why a company like AOL can still make a fortune.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">In conclusion</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In conclusion, the economy is a tremendous creature that can provide you with a lot if you plug yourself in. It's been growing for thousands of years and has a lot to offer. You can also to choose to stay largely unplugged from it, and that's okay too.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 25, 2010 — </span>Warren Buffet claims to follow an investment strategy of staying within his "circle of competence". That's why he doesn't invest in high tech--it's outside his circle.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think this is good advice. The tricky part is to figure out where to draw the circle.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here are my initial thoughts:</p>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li >Start with a small circle. Be conservative about where you draw the circle.</li>
<li >Do what you're good at as opposed to what you want to do. Our economy rewards specialization. You want to work on interesting problems, but it pays better to work on things you've done before. Use that money to explore the things you want to do.</li>
<li >Be a big fish in a small circle.</li>
<li >Spend time outside your circle, but expand it slowly. Definitely work hard to improve your skill set but don't overreach. It's better to have a solid core and build momentum from that than to be marginal in a lot of areas.</li></ol><p class="scrollViewSource">

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 25, 2010 — </span>I have a feeling critical thinking gets the least amount of brain's resources. The trick is to critically think about things, come to conclusions, and turn those conclusions into habits. The subconcious, habitual mind is much more powerful than the tiny little conscious, critically thinking mind.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you're constantly using the critical thinking part of your mind, you're not using the bulk of your mind. You're probably accomplishing a lot less than you could be.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Come to conclusions and build good habits. Let your auto pilot take over. Then occasionally come back and revisit your conclusions.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm trying to figure out where intelligence belongs. Bill Gates is a million times richer than many people; was Einstein a million times smarter than a lot of people? It seems highly unlikely. But how much smarter was he? Was he 1,000x smarter than the average joe? 100x smarter?</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 25, 2010 — </span>Maybe I'm getting old, but I'm starting to think the best way to "change the world" isn't to bust your ass building companies, inventing new machines, running for office, promoting ideas, etc., but to simply raise good kids. Even if you are a genius and can invent amazing things, by raising a few good kids their output combined can easily top yours. Nerdy version: you are a single core cpu and can't match the output of a multicore machine.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm not saying I want to have kids anytime soon. I'm just realizing after spending time with my family over on Cape Cod, that even my dad, who is a harder worker than anyone I've ever met and has made a profound impact with his work, can't compete with the output of 4 people (and their potential offspring), even if they each work only 1/3 as hard, which is probably around what we each do. It's simple math.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So the trick to making a difference is to sometimes slow down, spend time raising good kids, and delegate some of the world saving to them.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 25, 2010 — </span>Genetics, aka nature, plays the dominant role in predicting most aspects of your life, in my estimation.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Across every dimension in life your genes are both a glass ceiling--preventing you from reaching certain heights--and a cement foundation--making it unlikely you'll hit certain lows. How tall/short you will be, how smart/dumb you will be, how mean/nice you will be, how popular/lonely you will be, how athletic/clumsy, how fat/skinny, how talkative/quiet, how long/short you'll live, and so forth.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By the time you are born, your genes, place of birth, year of birth, parents--they're all set in stone, and the constraints on your life are largely in place. That's an interesting thought.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Nurture of course, plays a huge role in making you of course. Being born with great genes is irrelevant if you are malnourished, don't get early education, etc. But nurture cannot overcome nature. Our DNA is not at all maleable and no one knows if it ever will be. Nonetheless, it makes no sense to complain about nature. It is up to you to make the most of your starting hand. On the other hand, let us not be quick to judge others. I make that mistake a lot.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 25, 2010 — </span>Doctors used to recommend leeches to cure a whole variety of illnesses. That seems laughable today. But I think our recommendations today will be laughable to people in the future.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Recommendations work terrible for everyone but decently on average. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We are a long, long way from making good individual recommendations. You won't get good individual recommendations until your individual genome is taken into account. And even then it will take a while. We may never get to the point where we can make good individual recommendations.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So many cures and medicines work for a certain percentage of people, but for some people they can have detrimental or even fatal effects. People rave about certain foods, exercises, and so forth, without considering how differences in <a href="https://breckyunits.com/nature-verse-nurture.html">genetics</a> can have a huge role.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People are quite similar, but they are also quite different and react to different things in different ways. I think we are a long way away from seeing breakthroughs in recommendations.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Recommendations are great business, but I think we're 2 or 3 orders of magnitude away from where they could be, and it could take decades(or never) to reach those levels.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="you-cant-predict-the-future.html">You Can't Predict the Future</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 25, 2010 — </span>I've been very surprised to discover how unpredictable the future is. As you try to predict farther out, your error margins grow exponentionally bigger until you're "predicting" nothing specific at all.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Apparently this is because many things in our world are "chaotic". Small errors in your predictions get compounded over time. 10 day weather forecasts are notoriously inaccurate despite the fact that teams of the highest IQ'd people on earth have been working on them for years. I don't understand the math behind chaos but I believe in the basic ideas. </p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A Simple Example</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I can correctly predict whether or not I'll work out tomorrow with about 85% accuracy. All I need to do is look at whether I worked out today and whether I worked out yesterday. If I worked out those 2 days, odds are about 90% I will work out tomorrow. If I worked out yesterday but didn't work out today, odds are about 40% I will work out tomorrow. If I worked out neither of those two days, odds are about 20% I'll work out tomorrow.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">However, I can't predict with much accuracy whether or not I'll work out 30 days from now. That's because the biggest two factors depend on whether I work out 29 days from now and 28 days from now. And whether I work out 29 days from now depends on the previous 2 days the most. If I'm wrong in my predictions about tomorrow, that error will compound and throw me off. It's hard to make an accurate prediction about something so simple. Imagine how hard it is to make a prediction about a non-binary quantity.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Things You Can't Predict</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Weather, the stock market, individual stock prices, the next popular website, startup success, box office hits, etc. Basically dynamic, complex systems are completely resistant to predictions. </p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">On Model verse Off Model</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When making predictions you generally build a model--consciously or unconsciously. For instance, in predicting my future workouts I can make a spreadsheet (or just a "mental spreadsheet") where I come up with some inputs that are used to predict the future workout. My inputs might be whether I worked out today and whether it will rain. These are the "on model" factors. But all models leave things out that may or may not affect the outcome. For example, it could be sunny tomorrow and I could have worked out today, so my model would predict a workout tomorrow. But then I might get injured on my way to the gym--an "off model" risk that I hadn't taken into account.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Avoid Making Predictions & Run From People Pushing Predictions</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The world is complex and impossible to predict accurately. But people don't get this. They think the world is easier to explain and predict than it really is. And so they demand predictions. And so people provide them, even though these explanations and predictions are bogus. Feel free to make or listen to long term predictions for entertainment, but don't believe any long term predictions you hear. We're a long way(possibility an infinitely long way) from making accurate predictions about the long run.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Inside Information</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What if you have inside information? Should you then be able to make better predictions than others? Let's imagine for a moment that you were alive in 1945 and you were trying to predict when WWII would end. If you were like 99.99999+% of the population, you would have absolutely no idea that a new type of bomb was just invented and about to be put to use. But if you were one of the few who knew about the bomb, you might have been a lot more confident that the war was close to an end. Inside information gives you a big advantage in predicting the future. If you have information and can legally "bet on that", go for it. However, even the most connected people only have the inside scoop on a handful of topics, and even if you know something other people don't it's very hard to predict the scale (or direction) of an event's effect. </p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Be Conservative</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My general advice is to be ultra conservative about the future and ultra bullish on the present. Plan and prepare for the worst of days--but without a pessimistic attitude. Enjoy today and make safe investments for tomorrow.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 23, 2010 — </span>Your most recent experiences effect you the most. Reading this essay will effect you the most today but a week from now the effect will have largely worn off. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Experiences have a half-life. The effect decays over time. You might watch Almost Famous, run out to buy a drumset, start a band, and then a month later those drums could be gathering dust in your basement. You might read Shakespeare and start talking more lyrically for a week.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Newer experiences drown out old ones. You might be a seasoned Rubyist and then read an essay espousing Python and suddenly you become a Pythonista. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All genres of experiences exhibit the recency effect. Reading books, watching movies, listening to music, talking with friends, sitting in a lecture--all of these events can momentarily inspire us, influence our opinions and understanding of the world, and alter our behaviors.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Taking Advantage of the Recency Effect</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you believe in the recency effect you can see the potential benefit of superstitious behavior. For instance, I watched "The Greatest Game Ever Played", a movie about golf, and honest to god my game improved by 5 strokes the next day. A year later when I was a bit rusty, I watched it again and the effect was similar(though not as profound). When I want to write solid code, I'll read some quality code first for the recency effect.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you want to do great work, set up an inspiring experience before you begin. It's like taking a vitamin for the mind.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Some More Examples</h1>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Settlers of Cataan can make you an astute businessman after a few games. You'll find yourself negotiating everything and saving/making money left and right. </li>
<li >Influence by Cialdini will give you a momentary force field against the tricks of pushy salespeople and also temporarily boost your own ability to get people to do what you want.</li>
<li >Watching Jersey Shore will temporarily make you feel much better about your life while at the same time altering your vocabulary with phrases like "You do you" and "GTL".</li></ul>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 11, 2010 — </span>I've had some free time the past two weeks to work on a few random ideas I've had. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">They all largely involve probability/statistics and have no practical or monetary purpose. If I was a painter and not a programmer you might call them "art projects".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">One project deals with categorizing data into "Extremistan" and "Mediocristan". <a href="https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com">Taleb's books</a>, the Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, list a number of different examples for each, and I thought it would be interesting to extend that categorization further.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The second project I'll expand on a bit more here.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">TheOvarianLottery.com</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Warren Buffett coined the idea of the "ovarian lottery"--his basic idea is that the most important factor in determining how you end up in life is your birth. You either are born "lucky"--in a rich country, with no major diseases, to an affluent member of society, etc.--or you aren't. Other factors like hard work, education, smart decision making and so forth have a role, but play a relatively tiny role in determining what your life will be like.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I thought this was a very interesting idea and so I started a program that lets you be "born again" and see how things turn out. When you click "Play", theOvarianLottery will show you:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >What year you were born in(or you can choose this yourself)</li>
<li >What continent/country you were born in</li>
<li >What your gender is</li>
<li >How old you will be when you die</li>
<li >Your Religion</li>
<li >Silly things like whether you will ever be a Facebook user (with 500 million users potentially 1 in every 200 people that has ever lived has used Facebook!)</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Two Surprises</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've encountered two major surprises with the theOvarianLottery.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First, I thought theOvarianLottery would take me an hour or two. I was wrong. It turns out the coding isn't hard at all--the tricky part is finding the statistics. Not a whole lot of countries provide detailed statistics on their current populations. Once you start looking up stats for human population before 1950, the search gets an order of magnitude harder. (I've listed a few good sources and resources at the bottom of this post if anyone's interested)</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Second, I've found so many fascinating diversions while working on this. I've encountered cool stats like:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Estimates on the total number of births that have happened so far range from 40 - 150 billion. This doesn't include species prior to homo sapiens.</li>
<li >Around 1 in 5 births today happens in China. Odds of being born in the U.S. are around 4%.</li>
<li >Potentially around 40% of all babies that have ever been born have died before the age of 1. Nowadays the infant mortality rate is around 2% (and less in many countries).</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But cooler than interesting descriptive statistics are the philosophical questions that this idea of the Ovarian Lottery raises. If I was a philosopher I might ponder these questions at depth and write more about each one, but I don't think that's a great use of time and so I'll just list them. Philosophy is most often a fruitless excercise.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">How does the real Ovarian Lottery work?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My site is just a computer program. It's interesting to think about how the real ovarian lottery works. Is there a place where everyone is hanging out, and then you spin a wheel and your "soul" is magically transported to a newborn somewhere in the world?</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What if the multiverse theory is correct?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">multiverse</a> theory is correct, then my odds are almost certainly off. In other words, theOvarianLottery assumes there's only 1 universe and extrapolates the odds from that. If there are dozens or infinite universes, who knows what the real odds are.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What role has chaos played in the development of humanity?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you go back to around 10,000 B.C., somewhere around 2-10 million people roamed the planet. Go back earlier and the number is even smaller. It's interesting to think of how small differences in events back then would have created radically different outcomes today. I've dabbled a bit into chaos theory and find it quite humbling.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What does the fact that we are alive today tell us about the future?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Depending on the estimate, between 4-20% of all humans that have ever lived are alive today. In other words, the odds of you being alive right now (according to my model) are higher than they've ever been. The odds of you being alive in 10,000 BC are over 1,000 times less. If humans indeed go on to live for another ten thousand years and the population grows another 1,000 times the odds of you being born today would be vastly smaller. In other words, if my model represented reality than we could conclude that odds are high that the human population does not continue growing like it has.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What's the future shape of the population curve?</h4>
</div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="World-Population-1800-2100.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="World-Population-1800-2100.png" width="2050" height="2092" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The growth of human population has followed an exponential curve. How long will it last? Will earth become overpopulated? Will we invent technology to leave earth? Will human population decline? Human population growth is hard to predict over any long term time period.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Complete Uselessness of This Model</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I don't believe you can take the concept of the Ovarian Lottery any more seriously than you can take religion. It provides food for thought, but it doesn't provide any real answers to much. The stats though could certainly be used in debates.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Oh well. Ars gratia artis</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I hope to finish up theOvarianLottery and slap a frontend on it sometime in the future.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="happiness-is-in-mediocristan.html">Happiness is in Mediocristan</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 6, 2010 — </span>Three unexpected things have happened to me during my two years of entrepreneurial pursuits in California.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First, I have not gotten rich.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Second, I have met many people who have gotten rich. I've even had the pleasure to witness some of my friends get rich.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Third, I've yet to meet someone much happier than me.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've met a large amount of people who are 6, 7, even 8 <em>orders of magnitude richer than me</em> and yet not a single one of them was even close to an <em>order of magnitude happier than me</em>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The explanation, I finally realized, is simple.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Happiness is a physical quantity, like Height or Weight</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Happiness, as <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">NNT</a> would say, resides in <a href="http://emergic.org/2007/06/07/tech-talk-black-swan-mediocristan-and-extremistan/">Mediocristan</a>. Happiness is a physical condition and just as it is impossible to find someone 60 feet tall, it is impossible to find someone ten times happier than everyone else. I could sit next to you and drink 3 cups of coffee, and sure, I might be 20% happier than you for about 20 minutes, but 1,000% happier? Not even close.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Our happiness is a result of some physical processes going on in our brains. While we don't understand yet the details of what's happening, from observation you can see that people only differ in happiness about as much as they differ in weight.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Millionaire Entrepreneurs Do Not Leap Out of Bed Every Morning</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This idea of happiness being distributed rather equally might not be surprising to people with common sense. There are a million adages that say the same thing. Thinking about it mathematically took me by surprise, however.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was rereading the Black Swan at the same time I was reading Zappos founder Tony Hsieh's "Delivering Happiness". In his autobiography, Tony talks about how he wasn't much happier after selling his first company for a 9 figure sum. I thought about this for a bit and realized I wasn't suprised. I've read the same thing and even witnessed it happen over and over again amongst startup founders who strike it rich. The change in happiness doesn't reflect the change in the bank account. <em>Not at all!</em> The bank account undergoes a multi-order of magnitude shift, while the happiness level fluctuates a few percentage points at best. It dawned on me that happiness is in Mediocristan. Of course!</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Don't, Don't Stress Over Getting Rich</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm not warning you that you might not become an order of magnitude happier if you become rich, I'm telling you <strong>IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE</strong>!!! There's no chance of it happening. You can be nearly as happy today as you will be the week after you make $1 billion. (In rare cases, you might even be less happy after you strike it rich.) Money is great, and having a ton of it would be pretty fun. By all means, try to make a lot of it. You will most likely be at least a few percentage points happier. Just remember to keep it in a realistic perspective. Aim to be 5 or 10% happier, not 500% happier.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's funny, although our society doles out vastly different rewards, at the end of the day, in what matters the most, mother nature has created a pretty equal playing field.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="orbits.html">Orbits</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 6, 2010 — </span>In February I celebrated my 26th Orbit. I am 26 orbits old. How many orbits are you?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think we should use the word "orbit" instead of year. It's less abstract. The earth's 584 million mile journey around the sun is an amazing phenomena, and calling it merely "another year" doesn't do it justice.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Calling years orbits also makes life sound more like a carnival ride--you get a certain number of orbits and then you get off. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Enjoy the ride!</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >1. Neat fact: The sun completes a revolution around the center of the Milky Way galaxy once every 250 million years. It is estimated to have completed <a href="http://www.quora.com/The-Moon-orbits-the-Earth-and-the-Earth-orbits-the-Sun-What-does-the-Sun-orbit">25 orbits</a> during the lifetime of our Sun, and less than one orbit since the origin of humans.</li>
<li >2. My roommate Andrew suggests the reason why we don't refer to a year as an orbit is perhaps because when we started calling things years, we didn't yet know that the earth revolved around the sun. Bad habits die hard.</li>
<li >3. I think the orbit around the sun has more impact on our world than we even realize. In other words, seasonality's affects are underestimated. Perhaps when you give something a name it seems less threatening. We call the change from August to December "fall", and thus we underestimate the volatility and massive change that occurs all around us.</li>
<li >4. We should also call days "revs". Okay I'm done.</li></ul>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="what-i-want.html">What I Want</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 6, 2010 — </span>Figuring out what you want in life is very hard. No one tells you exactly what you want. You have to figure it out on your own.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you're young, it doesn't really matter what you want because your parents choose what you do. This is a good thing, otherwise kids would grow up uneducated and malnourished from ice cream breakfasts. But when you grow up, you get to call the shots.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">You Need Data to Figure Out What You Want</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The big problem with calling the shots is that what your conscious, narrative mind thinks you want and what your subconscious mind really wants often differ quite a lot. For instance, growing up I said I wanted to be in politics, but in reality I always found myself tinkering with computers. Eventually you have the "aha" moment, and drop things you thought you wanted and focus on the things that you really want, the things you keep coming back to.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you pay attention to what you keep drifting back to, you'll figure out what you want. You just have to pay attention. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Collect data on what makes you happy as you go. Run experiments with your life.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You don't have to log what you do each day and run statistics on your life. But you do have to get out there and create the data. Try different things. Try different jobs, try different activities, try living in different places. Then you'll have experiences--data--which you can use to figure out exactly what the hell it is you really want.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">You Want More Than You Think</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People like to simplify things as much as possible. It would be nice if you only wanted a few things, such as a good family, a good job, and food on the table. I think though that in reality we each want somewhere around 10 to 20 different things. On my list of things I want, I've got 15 or 16 different things. Family, money, and food are on there. But also some more specific things, like living in the San Francisco Bay area, and studying computer science and statistics.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Being Happy is About Balancing All of These Things</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You don't get unlimited hours in the day so you've got to budget your time amongst all of these things that you want. If I were to spend all of my time programming, I'd have no time for friends and family, which are two things really important to me. So I've got to split my energies between these things. You'll always find yourself neglecting at least one area. Life is a juggling act. The important thing is to juggle with the right balls. It's fine to drop a ball for a bit, just pick it back up and keep going.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Limit the Bad Stuff</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">As you grow up you'll learn that there are things you want that aren't so good for you. Don't pretend you don't want that, just try to minimize it. For instance, part of me wants to eat ice cream almost everyday. But part of me wants to have healthy teeth, and part of me wants to not be obese. You've got to strike a balance.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Your Wants Change</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First, you've got to figure out all the different things you want. Then, you've got to juggle these things as best as possible. Finally, when you think you've got it figured out, you'll realize that your wants have changed slightly. You might want one thing a bit less (say, partying), while wanting something else more (a career, a family, learning to sail, who knows). That's totally normal. Just add or drop the new discovery to your list and keep going.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Make a Mindmap</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Almost 2 years ago I made a dead simple mindmap of what I wanted. I think a mindmap is better than a list in this case because A) it looks cooler and B) there's not really a particular ranking with what I want. My list has changed by just one or two things in 2 year's time. </p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I like to be mysterious and have something to talk about at parties, so I've gone ahead and erased most of the items, but you can get the idea:</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="the-do-you-know-game-and-why-we-need-celebrities.html">The Do You Know Game and Why We Need Celebrities</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 3, 2010 — </span>Last night over dinner we had an interesting conversation about why we care about celebrities. Here's my thinking on the matter.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Celebrities are not that special</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you look at some stats about the attributes of celebrities, you'll realize something interesting: they're not that special. By any physical measure--height, weight, facial symmetry, body shape, voice quality, personality, intelligence--celebrities are not much different from the people around you. Conan O'Brien might be a bit funnier than your funniest friend, but he wouldn't make you laugh 10x more; it'd be more like 5% more. Angelina Jolie might be 10% more attractive than your most attractive friend, but for some groups she could even be less attractive.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If these people aren't so special, why do they interest us so much? One explanation is that we see these people over and over again on television and as a result we are conditioned to care about them.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I concede this may be part of it, but I actually don't think celebrities are forced upon us. Instead, I think we <em>need</em> celebrities. We need them to function in a global society. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's all because of the Do You Know Game.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Do You Know Game</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The Do You Know Game is a popular party game. People often play it every time they meet a stranger. It goes something like this:</p>
</div></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Where are you from?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>Brockton, Massachusetts</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Oh, do you know Greg Buckley?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>Yes, I know Greg Buckley.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Cool! That's so funny! Small world!!!</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That's the basic premise. You ask me where I am from. You think of everyone you know from that place and ask me one by one if I know that person. Then we switch roles and play again.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People play this game at work, at parties, at networking events, at college--especially at college. This game has a benefit.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Do You Know Games Lets Strangers Build Trust</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People play this game for many reasons, but certainly one incentive to play is that if two strangers can identify a mutual friend, they can instantly trust each other a bit more. If we have a mutual friend, I'm more likely to do you a favor, and less likely to screw you over, because word gets around. Back in the day when people carried swords, this was even more important.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A mutual friend also gives two strangers a shared interest. It's something that they can continually talk about. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And having a mutual friend can reveal a lot about a person:</p>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Do you know Breck Yunits?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>Yes, I think he's an idiot.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>No YOU'RE the idiot.</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">As you can see, having mutual friends serves many purposes.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The Do You Know Game has gotten harder as the world has globalized</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Throughout the 20th century, the proportion of people that have traveled far from their hometowns for school or career has steadily increased. The further you travel from your home, the less likely you are to have a successful round of "do you know" with a stranger. You might share common interests or values with the new people you meet, but you'll know none of the same people and thus it will be harder to build and grow relationships. This is a big problem for a globalized society that depends on strong ties between people from different places to keep the economy running smoothly.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Celebrities to the Rescue</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Celebrities have naturally arisen to fill a need for strangers in a globalized world to have mutual friends. We all interact with strangers more frequently nowadays, and if we didn't have celebrities, there would be a gaping hole in our arsenal of shortcuts to establishing trust with new people. There are a thousand ways to build repoire with a stranger, but the technique of talking about a shared acquaintance is one of the easiest and most effective. We travel farther than we ever have, but thanks to celebrities, we still have dozens of "mutual friends" wherever we go.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Of course, just because two people know who Tom Hanks is doesn't mean they should trust each other more. Tom Hanks doesn't know them and so none of the "word gets around" stuff I mentioned earlier applies. I'm not arguing that celebrities are an equal substitute for a mutual friend by any means. A mutual friend is a much more powerful bond than knowing about the same celebrity.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But celebrities are better than nothing.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="design-matters-a-lot.html">Design Matters. A lot.</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">July 2, 2010 — </span>A year ago I wrote a post titled "The Truth about Web Design" where I briefly argued that "design doesn't matter a whole lot."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My argument was: "you go to a website for the utility of it. Design is far secondary. There are plenty of prettier things to look at in the real world."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I do think the real world is a pretty place, but about design, I was completely wrong.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I now think design is incredibly important, and on par with engineering. I used to think a poorly designed product was a matter of a company setting the right priorities, now I think it reflects ignorance, laziness or mediocrity. If a company engineers a great product but fails to put forward a great design, it says:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >1. The company doesn't feel that design is important.</li>
<li >2. The company was too lazy to put much effort into design.</li>
<li >3. The company's engineering team is incapable of working effectively with the design team.</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Why Design is Important, In Princple</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For nearly a decade I've always dreamed of my ideal computer as no computer at all. I wanted a computer smaller than the smallest smartphone, that would always be ready to take commands but would also be out of site. In other words, I've always thought of computers purely as problem solving tools--as a means to an end. </p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I want the computer to solve the problem and get out of my way. Computers are ugly. The world is beautiful. I like to look at other people, the sky, the ocean and not a menu or a screen. I didn't care about the style in which the computer solved my problem, because no matter how "great" it looked it couldn't compare to the natural beauty of the world. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was wrong.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A computer, program, or product should always embody a good design, because the means to the end is nearly important as the end itself.  True, when riding in a car I care about the end--getting to my destination. But why shouldn't we care about the style in which we ride? Why shouldn't we care about the means? After all, isn't living all about appreciating the means? We all know what the end of life is, the important thing is to live the means with style. I've realized that I want style--and I'm a little late to the party, most people want style.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Why Design is Important, In Practice</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If that argument didn't make sense, there are a number of practical reasons why a great design is important.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>A great design can unlock more value for the user.</strong> Dropbox overcomes herculean engineering challenges to work, but if it weren't for its simple, easy to use design it wouldn't be nearly as useful. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>A great design can be the competitive edge in a competive market.</strong> Mint.com had a great design, and it bested a few other startups in that emerging market.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>A great design can be the differentiator in a crowded market.</strong> Bing's design is better than Google's. The design of Bing differentiates the two search engines in my mind, and makes Bing more memorable to me. The results of Microsoft's search engine have always been decent, but it was the design of Bing that finally gave them a memorable place in consumers' minds.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>A great design is easy to get people behind.</strong> People like to support sites and products that are designed well. People love to show off their Apple products. Airbnb's beautiful design had a large role in making it easy for people to support the fledgling site.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">What to do if you aren't good at design</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Personally, I'm a terrible designer. Like many hackers, I can program but I can't paint. What should we do? </p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">First, learn to appreciate the importance of design. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Second, learn to work well with designers. Don't treat design as secondary to engineering. Instead, think of how you can be a better engineer to execute the vision of your design team. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Great engineering can't compensate for poor design just as great design can't compensate for poor engineering. To create great products, you need both. Don't be lazy when it comes to design. It could be the make or break difference between your product's success or failure.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 28, 2010 — </span>Competition and specialization are generally positive economics forces. What's interesting is that they are contradictory.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Competition</strong>. Company 1 and Company 2 both try to solve problem A. The competition will lead to a better outcome for the consumer.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Specialization</strong>. Company 1 focuses on problem A; Company 2 focuses on problem B. The specialization will lead to a better outcome for all because of phenomena like economies of scale and comparative advantage.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So which is better? Is it better to have everyone compete to solve a small number of problems or to have everyone specialize on a unique problem?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Well, you want both. If you have no competition, it's either because you've been able to create a nice monopolostic arrangement for yourself or it's because you're working on a problem no one cares about. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you have tons of competition, you're probably working on a problem that people care about but that is hard to make a profit in.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Update 8/6/2010</strong>: Overspecialization can be bad as well when things don't go according to plan, as NNT points out, <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/robustness.pdf">Mother Nature does not like overspecialization</a>, as it limits evolution and weakens the animals.

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 17, 2010 — </span>Doing a startup is surprisingly simple. You have to start by creating a product that people must have, then you scale it from there.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What percent of your customers or "users" would be disappointed if your product disappeared tomorrow? If it's less than 40%, you haven't built a must have yet.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">As simple as this sounds, I've found it to be quite hard. It's not easy to build a must have.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Some Reasons Why Startups Fail to Build a Must Have</h1>
</div></div>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li ><strong>Lack of ability</strong>. If you want to build a plane that people can't wait to fly on, you probably need to be an aerospace engineer. If you want to draw a comic that people can't wait to read, you probably need to be a talented artist and comedian to boot. You might have a great idea for a search engine, but if you don't have a PhD level understanding of math and computer science, your search engine is quite unlikely to become a must have when people have Google. You need a talented team in the product area to build a must have.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="2."><li ><strong>Release too late</strong>. A lot of people take too long to release and get feedback. The odds of your first iteration being a must have are quite slim. People aren't going to get it like you get it. You'll need to iterate. If you burn up all your money and energy before releasing, you might not leave yourself with enough time to tweak your product until it's a must have. Give yourself ample time, release early.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="3."><li ><strong>Lack of vision</strong>. It seems like successful entrepreneurs have a clear vision about what people will want ahead of time. There are endless directions in which you can take your product. Sometimes a product will get started in the right direction, but then will be tweaked into a dead end. I think you need a simple, clear, medium to long term vision for the product.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="4."><li ><strong>Preoccupation with Unimportant Things</strong>. A lot of founders get bogged down with minor details like business plans or equity discussions or fundraising processes. If you don't put your focus almost entirely on creating a must have product, none of this stuff will matter. Your company needs a reason to exist, without a must have product, there isn't one. (Unless of course, you are trying to create a lifestyle business, in which your first priority is a good lifestyle, then by all means do things in which ever way you want).</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="5."><li ><strong>Too broad a focus</strong>. Every successful business starts with a small niche. You need to create a must have product for a few people before you can create one for a lot of people. If your business is a two sided marketplace, pick a very small market to start in, and grow it from there.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="6."><li ><strong>Get tired of the space</strong>. This is a mistake I've made a lot. I've come up with a simple idea that I think is cool, I launch it, then when the going gets tough, I realize I'm not too interested in the space. No matter what the idea or space, there are going to be low moments when you don't have a growing, must have product, and if your passion isn't in that industry, you might not want to keep going. Pick a space that you think is cool; build a product that you want.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="7."><li ><strong>Stubbornness</strong>. Sometimes people are too stubborn to realize that their product isn't something people want. If people don't care if it disappeared tomorrow, you need to improve it! Don't be stubborn. Listen to the numbers. Listen to feedback.</li></ol>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="flip-flopping.html">Flip Flopping</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 16, 2010 — </span>Every Sunday night in college my fraternity would gather in the commons room for a "brother meeting". (Yes, I was in a fraternity, and yes I do regret that <a href="http://brosicingbros.com">icing</a> hadn't been invented yet). These meetings weren't really "productive", but we at least made a few decisions each week. The debates leading up to these decisions were quite fascinating. The questions would be retarded, like whether or not our next party should be "Pirate" themed or "Prisoner" themed(our fraternity was called Pike, so naturally(?) we were limited to themes that started with the letter P so we could call the party "Pike's of the Caribbean" or something). No matter what the issue, we would always have members make really passionate arguments for both sides.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The awesome thing was that these were very smart, persuasive guys. I'd change my mind a dozen times during these meetings. Without fail, whichever side spoke last would have convinced me that not only should we have a Pirate themed party, but that it was quite possibly one of the most important decisions we would ever make.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The thing I realized in these meetings is that flip flopping is quite easy to do. It can be really hard, if not impossible, to make the "right" decision. There are always at least two sides to every situation, and choosing a side is a lot more about the skills of the debaters, the mood you happen to be in, and the position of the moon(what I'm trying to say is there's a lot of variables at work). </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think humans are capable of believing almost anything. I think our convictions are largely arbitrary.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Try an experiment. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">1) Take an issue, a political issue--the war in Afghanistan, Global Warming, marijuana legalization--or a minor everyday issue--what to have for dinner tonight, whether it's better to drink coffee or not, whether Facebook is a good thing or bad thing. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">2) Take a stand on that issue. Think of all the reasons why your stand is right. Be prepared to support your stance in a debate.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">3) Completely change your position. Take the other side. Think of every reason why this new side is correct. Be prepared to support this side without feeling like you are lying.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">4) Keep flipping if you want.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think it's fascinating to see how now matter what the issue, you can create a convincing case for any side. And it's hard not to hear an argument for the opposing side and not want to change your position. Our brains can be easily overloaded. The most recently presented information pushes out the old arguments.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But at some points, survival necessitates we take a side. The ability to become stubborn and closed-minded is definitely a beneficial trait. Survival causes us to become stubborn on issues and survival requires closed-mindedness to get anything done.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Three men set out to find a buried treasure. The first guy believes the treasure is to the north so heads in that direction. The second guy heads south. The third guy keeps changing his mind and zigzags between north and south. I don't know who finds the treasure first, but I do know it's certainly not the third guy.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Oftentimes the expected value of being stubborn is higher than the expected value of being thoughtful.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Is flip flopping a good thing? Is being open minded harder than being stubborn? Does it depend on the person? Does success require being certain?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I have no idea.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 15, 2010 — </span>I think it's interesting to ponder the value of information over it's lifetime.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Different types of data become outdated at different rates. A street map is probably mostly relevant 10 years later, while a 10 year old weather forecast is much less valuable.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Phone numbers probably last about 5 years nowadays. Email addresses could end up lasting decades. News is often largely irrelevant after a day. For a coupon site I worked on, the average life of a coupon seemed to be about 2 weeks. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If your data has a long half life, then you have time to build it up. Wikipedia articles are still valuable years later.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What information holds value the longest? What are the "twinkies" of the data world?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Books, it seems. We don't regularly read old weather forecasts, census rolls, or newspapers, but we definitely still read great books, from Aristotle to Shakespeare to Mill.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Facts and numbers have a high churn rate, but stories and knowledge last a lot longer.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 14, 2010 — </span>Have you heard of the Emperor Penguins? It's a species of penguins that journeys 30-75 miles across the frigid Antarctic to breed. Each year these penguins endure 8 months of brutally cold winters far from food. If you aren't familiar with them, check out either of the documentaries March of the Penguins or Planet Earth.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think the culture of the emperor penguins is fascinating and clearly reveals some general traits from all cultures:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Culture is a set of habits that living things repeat because that's what they experienced in the past, and the past was favorable to them. Cultures have a mutually dependent relationship with their adherents.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The Emperor Penguins are born into this Culture. The Culture survives because the offspring keep repeating the process. The Emperor Penguins survive because the process seems to keep them safe from predators and close to mates. The culture and the species depend on each other.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Cultures are borne out of randomness.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At any moment, people or animals are doing things that may blossom into a new culture. Some of these penguins could branch off to Hawaii and start a new set of habits, which 500 years from now might be the dominant culture of the Emperor Penguins.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But predicting what will develop into a culture and what won't is impossible--there's too many variables, too much randomness involved. Would anyone have predicted that these crazy penguins who went to breed in the -40 degree weather for 8 months would survive this long? Probably not. Would anyone have predicted that people would still pray to this Jesus guy 2,000 years later? Probably not.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Cultures seem crazy to outsiders and are almost impossible to explain.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">One widespread human culture is to always give an explanation for an event even when the true reason is just too complex or random to understand. The cultural habits are always easier to repeat and pass down then they are to explain.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I don't have any profound insights on culture, I just think it's fascinating and something not to read too much into---it helps us survive, but there's no greater meaning to it.</p>

</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Or..We Think we have Free Will because we only Observe One Path.</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 24, 2010 — </span>"Dad, I finished my homework. Why?"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The father thinks for a moment. He realizes the answer involves explaining the state of the world prior to the child doing the homework. It involves explaining the complex probabilities that combined would calculate the odds the child was going to do the homework. And it likely involved explaining quantum mechanics.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The father shrugs and says "Because you have free will, and chose to do it."</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Free Will was Born</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Thus was born the notion of free will, a concept to explain why we have gone down certain paths when alternatives seemed perfectly plausible. We attribute the past to free will, and we attribute the unpredictability of the future to free will as well (i.e. "we haven't decided yet").</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">One little problem</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The problem is, this is wrong. You never choose just one path to go down. In fact, you go down all the paths. The catch is you only get to observe one.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In one world the child did their homework. In another world, they didn't.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The child who did their homework will never encounter the child who didn't, but they both exist, albeit in different universes or dimensions. Both of them are left wondering why they "chose" the way they did. The reality is that they chose nothing. They're both just along for the ride.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Even the smug boy who says free will doesn't exist, is just one branch of the smug boy.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 22, 2010 — </span>Google has a list of <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/tenthings.html">10 principles</a> that guide its actions. Number 2 on this list is:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">It's best to do one thing really, really well.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This advice is so often repeated that I thought it would be worthwhile to think hard about why this might be the case.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why is it best to do one thing really, really well?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For two reasons: economies of scale and network effects.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Economies of scale</strong>. The more you do something, the better you get at it. You can automate and innovate. You'll be able to solve the problem better than it's been solved in the past and please more people with your solutions. You'll discover tricks you'd never imagine that help you create and deliver a better "thing".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Network effects</strong>. If you work on a hard problem for a long time, you'll put a great deal of distance between yourself and the average competitor, and in our economy it doesn't take too big a lead to dominate a market. If your product and marketing is 90% as good as the competitor's, it will capture much less than 47% of the market. The press likes to write about the #1 company in an industry. The gold medalist doesn't get 1/3 of the glory, they get 95% of the glory. The network effects in our economy are very strong. If you only do something really well, the company that does it really, really well will eat your lunch.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A simpler analogy: You can make Italian food and Chinese food in the same restaurant, but the Italian restaurant down the street will probably have better Italian food and the Chinese restaurant will probably have better Chinese food, and you'll be out of business soon.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why the <em>"really, really"</em>?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My English teacher would have told me that at least one of the "really"'s was unneccessary. But if you think about the statement in terms of math having the two "really"'s makes sense. </p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's define doing one thing well as being in the top 10% of companies that do that thing. Doing one thing really well means being in the top 1% of companies that do that thing. Doing one thing really, really well means being in the top 0.1% of companies that do that thing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Thus, what Google is striving for is to be the #1 company that does search. They don't want to just be in the top 10% or even top 1% of search companies, they want to do it so well that they are at the very top. If you think about it like that, the 2 "really's" make perfect sense.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What's the most common mistake companies make when following this advice?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My guess is they don't choose the correct "thing" for their given team. They pick the wrong thing to focus on. For instance, if Ben and I started a jellyfish business, and decided to do <a href="http://jellyfishart.com">jellyfish tanks</a> really, really well, we would be making a huge mistake because we just don't have the right team for that business. It makes more sense when <a href="http://www.jellyfishart.com/aboutus.asp">Al</a>, a marine biology major and highly skilled builder, decides to do jellyfish tanks really, really well.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It makes perfect sense for the Google founders to start Google since they were getting their PhD's in search.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You need good team/market fit. The biggest mistake people make when following the "do one thing really, really well" advice is choosing the wrong product or market for their team.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What's the second most common mistake companies make when following this advice?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Picking a "thing" that's too easy. You should go after a problem that's hard with a big market. Instead of writing custom software for ten of your neighbors that helps them do their taxes, generalize the problem and write internet software that can help anyone do their taxes. It's good to start small of course, but be in a market with a lot of room to grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Can you change the one thing you do?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Yes. It's good to be flexible until you stumble upon the one thing your team can do really, really well that can address a large market. Don't be stubborn. If at first you thought it was going to be social gaming, and then you learn that you can actually do photo sharing really, really well and people really want that, do photo sharing.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">How do you explain the fact that successful companies actually do a lot of different things?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Microsoft Windows brings in something like $15 billion per year. Google Adwords brings in something like $15 billion per year. When you make that kind of money, you can drop $100 million selling ice cream and it won't hurt you too much. But to get there, you've first got to do one hard thing really, really well, whether it be operating systems or search.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="the-hidden-benefits-of-automation.html">The Hidden Benefits of Automation</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 17, 2010 — </span>If you automate a process which you repeat <em>Y</em> times, that takes <em>X</em> minutes, what would your payoff be?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Payoff = <em>XY</em> minutes saved, right?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Surprisingly I've found that is almost never the case. Instead, the benefits are almost always greater than <em>XY</em>. In some cases, much greater. The benefits of automating a process are greater than the sum of the process' parts.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Actual Payoff = <em>XY minutes saved + E</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What is E? It's the extra something you get from not having to waste time and energy on XY.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">An Example</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Last year I did a fair amount of consulting work I found via craigslist. I used to check the Computer Gigs page for a few different cities, multiple times per day. I would check about 5 cities, spending about 2 minutes on each page, about 3 times per day. Thus, I'd spend 30 minutes a day just checking and evaluating potential leads.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I then wrote a script that aggregated all of these listings onto one page(including the contents so I didn't have to click to a new page to read a listing). It also highlighted a gig if it met a certain criteria that I had found to be promising. The script even automated a lot of the email response I would write to each potential client.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It cut my "searching time" down to about 10 minutes per day. But then something happened: I suddenly had more time and energy to focus on the <em>next aspect</em> of the problem: getting hired. It wasn't long before I was landing more than half the gigs I applied to, even as I raised my rates.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think this is where the unexpected benefits come from. The E is the extra energy you'll have to focus on other problems once you don't have to spend so much time doing rote work.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Automate. Automate. Automate</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Try to automate as much as possible. The great thing about automation is that once you automate one task you'll have more time to automate the next task. Automation is a great investment with compounding effects. Try to get a process down to as few steps or keystrokes as possible(your ideal goal is zero keystrokes). Every step you eliminate will pay off more than you think.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 19, 2010 — </span>All the time I overhear people saying things like "I will start excercising everyday" or "We will ship this software by the end of the month" or "I will read that book" or "I will win this race." I'm guilty of talking like this too.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The problem is that often, you say you will do something and you don't end up doing it. Saying "I will do", might even be a synonym for "I won't do".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Why does this happen? I don't think it's because people are lazy. I think it's because we overestimate our ability to predict the future. We like to make specific predictions as opposed to predicting ranges.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'll explain why we are bad at making predictions in a minute, but first, if you find yourself making predictions about what you will do that turn out to be wrong, you should fix that. You can either tone down your predictions, giving ranges instead. For instance, instead of saying "I think I will win the race", say "I think I will finish the race in the top 10". Or, even easier: stop talking about things you <em>will do</em> entirely, and only talk about things you <em>have done</em>. So, in the race example, you might say something like "I ran 3 miles today to train for the race." (If you do win the race, don't talk about it a lot. No one likes a braggert).</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="why-its-worth-it-to-buy-the-book.html">Why it's worth it to buy the book</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 17, 2010 — </span>If a book is worth reading, it's worth buying too.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you're reading a book primarily to gain value from it(as opposed to reading it for pleasure) you should always buy it unless it's a bad book.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The amount of value you can get from a book varies wildly. Most books are worthless. Some can change your life. For simplicity, let's say the value you can derive from any one book varies from 1 cent to $100,000(there are many, many more worthless books than there are of the really valuable kind). </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The <em>cost</em> however, does not vary as much. Books rarely cost more than $100, and generally average to about $15.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You shouldn't read a book that you think will offer you less than $100 in value. Time could be better spent reading more important books.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So let's assume you never read a book that gives you less than $100 in value. Thus, the cost of a physical copy of the book is at most 15% (using the $15 average price) of the value gained.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Would owning that book help you extract 15% more from it? It nearly always will. When you own a book, you can take it anywhere. You can mark it up. You can flip quickly through the pages. You can bookmark it. You can easily share it with a friend and then dicuss it. If these things don't help you get 15% more out of that book, I'd be very surprised.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Where it gets even more certain, is when you read a really valuable book--say a book offering $1,000 of value. Now you'd only need to get 1.5% more out of that book.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The investment in that case is a no brainer.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 2, 2010 — </span>My room was always messy. Usually because clothes were strewn everywhere On the floor, on the couch, anywhere there was a surface there was a pile of clothes. Dirty, clean, or mostly-clean scattered about. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I tried a dresser. I tried making a system where I had spaces for each type of clothing: shirts, pants, etc. Nothing worked.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then a friend saw my room and quipped, "Duh. You have too many clothes. Let's get rid of most of them."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So we did. About 75% of my clothes were packed up in garbage bags and sent off to the Salvation Army that day.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Ever since, my room has been at least 5x cleaner on average.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Almost always, there is one simple change you can make that will have <i>drastic</i> effects. This change is called <b>the least you can do</b>.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I had a website that was struggling to earn money even with a lot of visitors. I added AdSense and almost nothing happened. Then I moved the AdSense to a different part of the page and it suddenly made 5x more money. A week later I changed the colors of the ad and it suddenly made 2x as much money. Now the site makes 10x as much money and I barely did anything.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">These are trivial examples, but the technique works on real problems as well.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The key is to figure out what the "least you can do" is.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You can discover it by working harder or smarter:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li ><strong>The hard way.</strong> You can try a ton of things, go through a to-do list dozens of items long, and hope you hit upon it.</li>
<li ><strong>The smart way.</strong> You can invest time learning instead of doing. Reading books, learning new math or programming techniques, talking to other people, thinking critically, etc. You'll then have a much better hunch at what the "least you can do is".</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In reality you need to do things both ways. But try to put extra effort into doing things the smart way, and see where it takes you.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>

<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Thanks to <a href="http://massbeacon.com">Conor</a> for providing feedback.</li>
<li >I never shop for clothes. Once a year, maybe twice. The reason I had so many was because I never got rid of any clothes.</li>
<li >This AdSense site doesn't make a ton of money, but it now makes enough to pay all my server bills, which is nice.</li>
<li >Finding the least you can do is kind of like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a>. You are trying to find the smallest change you can make to turn the status quo into an improved version.</li>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="four-tips-to-improve-communication.html">Four Tips to Improve Communication</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 29, 2010 — </span>Good communication is overcommunication. Very few people overcommmunicate. Undercommunication is much more common. Undercommunication is also the cause of countless problems in business. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Instead of striving for some subjective "good communication", simply strive to overcommunicate. It's very unlikely you'll hit a point where people say "he communicates too much". It's much more likely you'll come up a bit short, in which case you'll be left with good communication.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here are 4 tips that will bring you closer to overcommunicating:</p>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li ><strong>Say the hard things</strong>. Often the hardest things to talk about are the most important things to talk about. If something is stressing you out, <em>just say it</em>. Getting it out there, even if not in the most eloquent way, is much better than not talking about it at all. A good strategy when approaching a hard subject is to bounce your approach off a neutral 3rd party to see if your angle is smart. Many times it's the other person who has something they're stressed about but isn't talking about. It's your job to be perceptive and ask them questions to get it out on the table.</li>
<li ><strong><a href="with-computers-dont-repeat-yourself-with-people-do-repeat-yourself.html">Repeat yourself</a></strong>. People have bad memories and even worse attention spans. Repeat yourself. If something is very important, repeat yourself multiple times. If someone hasn't gotten the message, it's more likely your fault for not repeating yourself enough than it is their fault for not getting it.</li>
<li ><strong>Use tools</strong>. Email, Facebook, Google Wave, Basecamp, Skype, Gchat, Dropbox, Github, Sifter...these are just a sample of the modern tools you can use to communicate. Embrace them. Try different ones. Try pen and paper and whiteboards. Ideally you'll find two or three tools that cover all the bases, but don't be afraid to use multiple tools even if you have to repeat yourself across them a bit.</li>
<li ><strong>Set a regular schedule</strong>. Set aside a recurring time for communication. It could be once a week or once a day. Even if there's nothing new to talk about, it will help to just go over the important topics again as you can rarely repeat yourself too much.</li></ol>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That's it. Good luck!</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="network-effects.html">Network Effects</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 22, 2010 — </span>Network effects are to entrepreneurs what compounding effects are to investors: a key to getting rich.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Sometimes a product becomes more valuable simply as more people use it. This means the product has a "network effect".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You're probably familiar with two famous examples of network effects:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Windows. People started using Microsoft Windows. Therefore, developers started building more software for Windows. This made Windows more valuable, and more people started to use it.</li>
<li >Facebook. People joined Facebook and invited their friends. Their friends joined which made the site more valuable to everyone. People invited more friends.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All businesses have network effects to some degree. Every time you buy a slice of pizza, you are giving that business some feedback and some revenue which they can use to improve their business.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Giant businesses took advantage of giant network effects. When you bought that pizza, you caused a very tiny network effect. But when you joined Facebook, you immediately made it a more valuable product for many other users(who could now share info with you), and you may even have invited a dozen more users. When a developer joins Facebook, they might make an application that improves the service for thousands or even millions of users, and brings in a similar number of new users.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The biggest businesses enabled user-to-user network effects. Only the pizza store can improve its own offering. But Facebook, Craiglist, Twitter, and Windows have enabled their customers and developers to all improve the product with extremely little involvement from the company.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>

</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Is there any subject which cannot be explained simply?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>No.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>What about quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, or rocket science? Surely these cannot be explained simply.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>Any and every subject that can be explained logically, can also be explained simply.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>So you are saying that even I can become an expert at quantum mechanics?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>No. I am saying that every logical thing there is to learn in quantum mechanics can be explained simply. This holds for all subjects. However, that does not mean that every person can master every subject. Only people that master the basic building blocks of human knowledge can master any subject.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>What are the basic building blocks of human knowledge?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>First, the ones you learn early on: reading, writing, and arithmetic. Then, a few you are not forced to learn: probability, statistics, evolution and psychology.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Why do I have to learn probability, statistics, evolution and psychology?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>Because these subjects explain 99% of what you see in the world. You need to learn probability and statistics to understand subjects like chemistry, physics, and engineering. You need to understand evolution and psychology to understand subjects like history, economics, government and religion. You need to know probability and statistics to understand these latter subjects as well. Thus, probability and statistics is as core to learning as reading, writing, and arithmetic.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>I took a prob/stat course in high school. Is that good enough?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>Probably not. After you took your reading and writing classes in elementary school, did you stop reading and writing or did you start practicing these skills everyday? You continued to use and practice them, right? Did you continue to practice your prob/stat skills? You should.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>You're wrong. I've mastered probability and statistics, evolution, and psychology, and there are still subjects I can't find simple explanations for.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>I'm not wrong. You just need to look in the right places. You probably won't find simple explanations in school. Schools are in the business of making learning seem complex and expensive. Better places to search for simple explanations: 🌎 Online. Sites like <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="http://www.ted.com/">Ted</a>, Wikipedia and Google. 📚 In books. Browse around Barnes & Noble or Borders. 💁‍♀️ From a friend. Find someone that knows the subject well and ask them to teach you.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Do I need to master the building blocks to be successful in life?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>No. But you need to know them if you want to be able to learn any subject.</span></div><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="with-computers-dont-repeat-yourself-with-people-do-repeat-yourself.html">With Computers: Don't Repeat Yourself. With People: DO Repeat Yourself</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 15, 2010 — </span>In computer programming, one of the most oft-repeated mottos is DRY: "Don't Repeat Yourself."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The downside of DRY's popularity is that programmers might start applying the principle to conversations with other humans. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This fails because computers and people are <em>polar opposites.</em> </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">With computers, you get zero benefit if you repeat yourself. With people, you get zero benefit if you <em>don't</em> repeat yourself!</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Four Ways Computers and People are Different</h1>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li ><strong>A computer's memory is perfect.</strong> A computer forgets nothing. Tell it something once, and it will remember it forever. A human remembers almost nothing. I forget what I had for breakfast 2 days ago. I don't remember which people I talked to last week, nevermind what was said. If memory were cheese, a computer's would be cheddar and a human's would be swiss. You've got to repeat yourself when communicating with people because people forget.</li>
<li ><strong>A computer is always paying attention.</strong> Computers are perfect listeners. They are always listening to your input and storing it in memory. You, the operator, are the only thing they care about. Computers don't have needs. They don't daydream or have cellphones(yet). People on the other hand, rarely if ever pay full attention. They zone in and out. It's hard to even tell if they're zoned in, as we've all learned it's better to nod our heads. People have their own needs and concerns and opinions. You've got to repeat yourself when communicating with people because people don't pay attention.</li>
<li ><strong>A computer understands your logic.</strong> When you write a program, a computer never misunderstands. It will execute the program exactly as you typed it. People, however, do not communicate so flawlessly. Until I was 22 I used to think "hors d'oeuvres" meant dress nice. I did not understand the pronunciation. One time a friend emailed me about an event and said "Our place. Hors d'oeuvres. 7pm" and I responded "Awesome. Will there be food?" You've got to repeat yourself when communicating with people because people don't understand.</li>
<li ><strong>A computer doesn't need to know what's most important.</strong> Computers don't make decisions on their own and so don't need to know what's most important. A computer will remember everything equally. Then it will sit awaiting your commands. It won't make decisions without you. A person, however, will make decisions without you and so needs to know the order of importance of things. For example, if you're not a fan of peanuts, you might tell the waiter once that you'd prefer the salad without nuts. But if you're deathly allergic to peanuts, you should probably repeat yourself a few times so the waiter knows there better not be any nuts on your salad. You've got to repeat yourself when communicating with people because people need to know what's most important.</li></ul>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A Numeric Explanation</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you tell something to your computer once:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >The odds the computer remembers: 100%.</li>
<li >The odds the computer was paying attention: 100%.</li>
<li >The odds the computer understood you: 100%.</li>
<li >The odds the computer gets the importance right: 100%.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you tell something to a person once:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >The odds the person remembers: 30%?</li>
<li >The odds the person was paying attention: 40%?</li>
<li >The odds the person understood you: 50%?</li>
<li >The odds the person gets the importance right: 30%?</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In other words, the odds of communicating perfectly are very low: <b>1.8%</b>! You are highly likely to run into at least one of those four problems. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, if you repeat yourself 1 time, and we assume independence, here's how the probabilities change:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >The odds the person remembers: 51%</li>
<li >The odds the person was paying attention: 64%</li>
<li >The odds the person understood you: 75%</li>
<li >The odds the person gets the importance right: 51%</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By repeating yourself just once you've increased the chances of perfect communication from 1.8% to <b>12.5%</b>! Repeat yourself one more time and the probability of perfect communication increases to over 90%. Well, in this simplistic model anyway. But I hope you get the idea.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Repeat yourself until you overcommunicate</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">To communicate well you should try to <em>overcommunicate</em>. Overcommunicating is hard to do. It's much easier and more common to undercommunicate. If you're not repeating yourself a lot, you're not overcommunicating.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">An example of how I repeat myself</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">On the various projects I'm involved with we use Gmail, Google Docs, Google Wave, Basecamp, Github, Sifter, gChat and Skype. Which one do I prefer?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">None of them. I prefer pen, paper, whiteboards and face-to-face meetings. I write down my own todo list and schedule with pen and paper. Then I login to these sites and repeat what I've written down for the sake of repeating myself to other people. This isn't inefficieny, it's good communication. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Some people prefer Google Docs, some prefer Basecamp. I'll post things to both, to ensure everyone knows what I'm working on.</p>

"How many people love this product?", "How can we make this simpler?", "Which of the 7 deadly sins does this appeal to?".

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 14, 2010 — </span>When a problem you are working on forces you to wait, do you wait or switch tasks?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For example, if you are uploading a bunch of new web pages and it's taking a minute, do you almost instinctively open a new website or instant message?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I used to, and it made me less productive. I would try to squeeze more tasks into these short little idle periods, and as a result I would get less done.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Multitasking during idle times <em>seems</em> smart</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Doing other things during idle times <em>seems</em> like it would increase productivity. After all, while you're waiting for something to load you're not getting anything done. So doing something else in the interim couldn't hurt, right? Wrong.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Switching tasks during idle times is bad, very bad</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">While you're solving one problem, you likely are "holding that problem in your head". It takes a while to load that problem in your head. You can only hold one important problem in your head at a time. If you switch tasks, even for a brief moment, you're going to need to spend X minutes "reloading" that problem for what is often only a 30 second vacation to Gmail, Facebook, Gchat, Hackernews, Digg, etc. It's clearly a bad deal.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Don't multitask</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you're doing something worth doing, give it all of your attention until it's done. Don't work on anything else, even if you're given idle time.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Why you can't multitask well</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Human intelligence is overrated. Even the smartest people I know still occasionally misplace their keys or burn toast. We are good at following simple tasks when we focus, most of the time. But we are not built for multitasking.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Can you rub your head clockwise? Can you rub your belly counterclockwise? Can you say your ABC's backwards? </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Dead simple, right? But can you do all three at once? If you can, by all means ignore my advice and go multitask.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Wait out those idle times</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If what you are doing is easy or mundane, multitasking is permissible because loading a simple problem like "laundry" into your head does not take much time. But if what you are doing is <em>important and worth doing</em>, you are obligated to give it your full attention and to wait out those "idle times". </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you switch tasks during your idle times, you're implying that the time to reload the problem is less than the time gained doing something else. In other words, you are implying what you are doing is not worth doing. If that's the case, why work on it at all?</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="how-to-buy-low-sell-high.html">How to Buy Low, Sell High</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 12, 2010 — </span>Whether you're an entrepreneur, a venture capitalist, a casual investor or just a shopper looking for a deal, you should know how to buy low and sell high. Buying low and selling high is not easy. It's not easy because it requires too things humans are notoriously bad at: long term planning and emotional control. But if done over a long period of time, buying low and selling high is a surefire way to get rich.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Warren Buffett is perhaps the king of buying low and selling high. These tips are largely regurgitated from his speeches and biographies which I've been reading over the past two years.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Let the market serve you, not instruct you.</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Everything has both a price and a value. Price is what you pay for something, value is what you get. The two rarely match. Both can fluctuate wildly depending on a lot of things. For instance, the price of gas can double or triple in a year based on events in the Middle East, but the value of a gallon of gas to you largely remains constant. </p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Don't let the market ever tell you the value of something--don't let it instruct you. Your job is to start figuring out the intrinsic value of things. Then you can take advantage when the price is far out of whack with the true value of something--you can make the market serve you.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Google's price today is $187 Billion. But what's its value? <em>The average investor assumes the two are highly correlated</em>. Assume the correlation is closer to 0. Make a guess about the true value of something. You may be way off the mark in you value estimating abilities, but honing that skill is imperative.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Be frugal.</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You've got to be in a position to take advantage of the market, and if you spend your cash on unnecessary things, you won't be. Buy food in bulk at Costco. Cut your cell phone bill or cancel it altogether. Trim the fat wherever you can. You'd be surprised how little you can live off of and be happy. Read <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8581">P.T. Barnum's "The Art of Moneygetting"</a> for some good perspective on how being frugal has been a key to success for a long time.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Always be able to say "no".</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The crazy market will constantly offer you "buy high, sell low" deals. You've got to be able to turn these down. If you don't have good cash flow or a cash cushion, it's very hard. That's why being frugal is so important.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Be Happy</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you're happy with what you have now it's easy to make good deals over the long run. Buying low and selling high requires long term emotional control. If you're unhappy or stressed, it's very hard to make clear headed decisions. Do what you have to do to get happy.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Make the Easy Deals</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Out of the tens of thousands of potential deals you can make every month, which ones should you act on? The easy ones. Don't do deals in areas that you don't understand. Do deals where you know the area well. I wouldn't do a deal in commodities, but I'd certainly be willing to invest in early stage tech startups.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Margin of Safety</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The easy deals have a wide margin of safety. An easy deal has a lot of upside. An easy deal with a wide margin of safety has little to no downside. Say a company has assets you determine are worth $1 Million and for some reason the company is selling for $950,000. Even if the company didn't grow, it has a good margin of safety because the price of its assets alone are worth more than the price you paid.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Read a lot</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How do you find these easy deals? You've got to read a lot. You've got to keep your eyes open. Absorb and think mathematically about a lot of information you encounter in everyday life.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Buy a business</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Businesses can be the ultimate thing to buy low and sell high because they have nearly unlimited upside. Real estate, gold, commodities, etc., can be good investments perhaps. But when's the last time you heard of someone's house going up 10,000%? Starting a business can be your best investment ever, as you are guaranteed to buy <em>extremely low</em>, and have the potential to sell <em>extremely high</em>.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 5, 2010 — </span>Possibly the biggest mistake a web startup can make is to develop in a bubble. This is based on my own experience launching 13 different websites over the past 4 years. The raw numbers:</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What is "the bubble"?</h4>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The bubble is the early, early product development stage. When new people aren't constantly using and falling in love with your product, you're in the bubble. You want to get out of here as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you haven't launched, you're probably in the bubble. If you're in "stealth mode", you're probably in the bubble. If you're not "launching early and often", you're probably in the bubble. If you're not regularly talking to users/customers, you're probably in the bubble. If there's not a steady uptick in the number of users in love with your product, you're probably in the bubble.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Why you secretly want to stay in the bubble</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A part of you always wants to stay in the bubble because leaving is <em>scary</em>. Launching a product and having it flop hurts. You hesitate for the same reason you hesitate before jumping into a pool in New England: sure, sometimes they're heated, but most of the time they're frickin freezing. If the reception to your product is cold, if no one falls in love with it, it's going to hurt.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The danger of the bubble</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You can stand at the edge of the pool for as long as you want, but you're just wasting time. Life is too short to waste time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In addition to wasting time, money and energy in the bubble (which can seem like a huge waste if your product flops), two things happen the longer you stay in the bubble:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >The marginal return of each additional unit of effort decreases.</li>
<li >Expectations increase.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This is a very bad combination that can lead to paralysis. The more you pour into your bubble product, the less impact your additional efforts will have yet at the same time the more you will expect your product to succeed.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Don't wait any longer: jump in the water, flee the bubble!</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">How to Flee the Bubble</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here are four easy strategies for leaving the bubble: launch, launch & drop, pick one & launch, or drop.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Launch</strong>. Post your product to your blog today. Email your mailing list. Submit it to Reddit or Hackernews or TechCrunch. Just get it out there and see what happens. Maybe it will be a success.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Launch & Drop</strong>. Maybe you'll launch it and the feedback will be bad. Look for promising use cases and tweak your product to better fit those. If the feedback is still bad, drop the product and be thankful for the experience you've gained. Move on to the next one.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Pick One & Launch</strong>. If you're product has been in the bubble too long, chances are it's bloated. Pick one simple feature and launch that. You might be able to code it from scratch in a day or two since you've spent so much time already working on the problem.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>Drop</strong>. Ideas are for dating not marrying. Don't ever feel bad for dropping an idea when new data suggests it's not best to keep pursuing it. It's a sign of intelligence.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That's all I've got. But don't take it from me, read the writings of web entrepreneurs who have achieved more success. (And please share what you find or your own experiences on HackerNews).</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="diversification-in-startups.html">Diversification in Startups</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>2021 Update: I think the model and advice presented here is weak and that this post is not worth reading. I keep it up for the log, and not for the advice and analysis provided.</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 24, 2009 — </span>Over the past 6 months, our startup has taken two approaches to diversification. We initially tried no diversification and then we tried heavy diversification.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In brief, my advice is:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Diversify heavily early. Then focus.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the early stages of your startup, put no more than 33% of your resources into any one idea. When you've hit upon an idea that you're excited about and that has product/market fit, then switch and put 80% or more of your resources into that idea.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">How Startups Diversify</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">An investor diversifies when they put money into different investments. For example, an investor might put some money into stocks, some into bonds, and some into commodities. If one of these investments nosedives, you won't lose all your money. Also, you have better odds that you'll pick some investments that generate good returns. The downside is that although you reduce the odds of getting a terrible outcome, you also reduce the odds of getting a great outcome.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A startup diversifies when it puts resources into different products. For example, a web startup might develop a search engine and an email service at the same time and hope that one does very well. </p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The 4 Benefits of Diversification for Startups</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There are 4 main benefits to diversify:</p>
</div></div>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li ><strong>Better odds</strong>. Creating multiple products increases the odds of finding a great idea in a great market. The Internet provides very fast feedback about whether you've found one. After building your team, the next big thing to decide is what product to focus on. You should not choose one until you're built a product you're excited about and found <a href="/make-something-40-of-your-customers-must-have.html">product/market fit</a>. You've found product/market fit when about 40% of your customers think your product is a must have.</li>
<li ><strong>Builds individual skills</strong>. Entrepreneurs need broad skillsets. Trying multiple products forces you to learn new skills. You may build a consumer video site and improve your technical scaling skills while at the same time be trying a B2B site and improving your sales skills.</li>
<li ><strong>Builds team skills</strong>. Doing multiple products gives you plenty of opportunities to interact with your team in varied situations. You'll learn faster what your teammates' strengths and weaknesses are. You'll also be forced to improve your team communication, coordination, delegation and product management skills.</li>
<li ><strong>It's fun</strong>. Let's be honest, the early stages of working on a new problem or idea are oftentimes the most stimulating and exciting. Instead of focusing on one product day in and day out that might or might not work, trying multiple ideas keeps your brain going and your enthusiasm high.</li></ol>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">When to Focus</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If diversifying has so many benefits, should you ever stop? Yes, you should.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Focus when you are ready to make money.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Coming up with new ideas and building new, simple products is the easy part of startups. Unfortunately, developing new solutions is <em>not</em> what creates a lot of value for other people. Bringing your solution to other people is when most value is created--and exchanged. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Imagine you're a telecom company and you build a fiber optic network on the streets of every city in America--but fail to connect people's homes to the new system. Although connecting each home can be hard and tedious, without this step no value is created and no money will come your way.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you hear the phrase "execution is everything", this is what it refers to. If you want to make money, and you've got a great team and found product/market fit, you've then got to focus and execute. Drop your other products and hunker down. Fix all the bugs in your main product. Really get to know your customers. Identify your markets and the order in which you'll go after them. Hire great people that have skills you are going to need.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Benefits of Focusing</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's recap the benefits of focusing.</p>
</div></div>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li >*Money. Creating new products in the early days is fun, but making money is fun too. Once you start focusing on growing one product, the money incentive will keep you motivated and spirits high.</li>
<li ><strong>Rewarding</strong>. Creating value for other people is perhaps the most rewarding feeling in life. Finding people with a problem, and getting your solution which solves their problem into their hands, is even better than the money you earn. You'll also create valuable jobs for your employees. </li>
<li ><strong>Resources</strong>. If you execute well, you'll end up with resources that you can use to put diversification back into the picture. For instance, after bringing better search to almost the whole world, Google can now diversify and create better email systems, web browsers, maps, etc.</li></ol>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Benefits of the "Diversify Early, Then Focus" approach: A Roulette Analogy</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you first begin your startup it's very similar to playing roulette. You plunk down some resources on an idea and then the wheel spins and you win more money or lose the money that you bet.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In roulette, you can bet it all on one number(focusing) or bet a smaller amount on multiple numbers(diversifying). If you bet it all on one number and win, you get paid a lot more money. But you're also more likely to lose it all.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The "game of startups" though, has two very important differences:</p>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li >You get more information after the game starts "spinning".</li>
<li >You can always move your bets around.</li></ol>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You get way more information about the odds of an idea "hitting the jackpot" after you plunked some time and money into it. You may find customers don't really have as big a problem as you thought. Or that the market that has this problem is much smaller than you thought. You may find one idea you thought was silly actually solves a big problem for people and is wildly popular.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You can then adjust your bets. If your new info leads you to believe that this idea has a much higher chance of hitting the jackpot, grab your resources from the other ideas and plunk them all down on this one. Or vice versa.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Don't Take My Word for It</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Sadly I bet there are paperboys who's businesses have done better than all mine to date, so take my advice with a grain of salt.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But if you want to learn more, I suggest reading the early histories of companies such as eBay, Twitter, and Facebook and see what their founders were up to before they founded those sites and in the following early period.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">And check back here, I'll hopefully be sharing how this approached worked for us.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 23, 2009 — </span>It is better to set small, meaningful goals than to set wild, audacious goals.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here's one way to set goals:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Make them good. Make them small.</blockquote>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Make them Good</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Good goals create value. Some examples:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Make a customer smile.</li>
<li >Teach someone math.</li>
<li >Learn how to cook.</li>
<li >Organize weather information.</li></ul>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Make them Small</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Start small. It is better to set one or two goals per time period than to set two dozen goals. Instead of a goal like "get 1,000,000 people to your website", start with a smaller goal like "get 10 people to your website."</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you exceed a goal and still think it's a good thing, raise the goal an order of magnitude. If you get those 10 visitors, aim for 100.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Why Small Goals Are Better</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Setting smaller goals is better because:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >It feels good when you exceed a goal. Occasionally you'll wildly exceed a goal and that will feel great.</li>
<li >It's better to do a few small good things, than to fail trying one audacious thing. </li>
<li >It's easier to accomplish an audacious thing by going one step(order of magnitude) at a time.</li>
<li >It's less stressful and makes you happier. Low expectations are good because in most cases you will exceed them and feel happy. High expectations, by definition, are bad because in most cases you will not meet them and feel bad. </li>
<li >Goals are arbitrary anyway. All goals are simply arbitrary constraints that help you focus--often with a team--to get stuff done. So since they're arbitrary, and as long as they're good goals, might as well make them simpler and easier.</li></ul>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Setting Ranges</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Another way to set goals is to use ranges. Set a low bar and a high bar. For example, your weekly goals might be:</p>
</div></div>
<table class="scrollTable"><thead><tr><th>LowBar</th>

<th>HighBar</th>

<th>What</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>2</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>new customers</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>2</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>product improvements</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>1</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>blog posts</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you exceed your low bar, you can be happy. If you exceed your high bar, you can be very happy. </p><p class="scrollViewSource">

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 20, 2009 — </span>Programming, ultimately, is about solving problems. Often I make the mistake of judging a programmer's work by the elegance of the code. Although the solution is important, what's even more important is the problem being solved.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Problems are not all created equal, so while programming you should occasionally ask yourself, "is this problem worth solving?"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here's one rubric you can use to test whether a problem is worth solving:</p>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li ><strong>Simplicity.</strong> Can you envision a simple solution to the problem? Can you create at least a partial, meaningful solution or prototype in a short period of time? Building a flying car would solve a lot of my transportation problems, but I don't see a simple path to getting there. Don't be too far ahead of your time. Focus on more immediate problems.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="2."><li ><strong>Value.</strong> Would solving this problem create value? Sometimes it's hard to predict in advance whether or not your solution would create value for people. The easiest way to tell if you've succeeded is if anyone would be disappointed if your solution were to disappear. If you can get a first prototype into people's hands early, you'll find out quickly whether or not you are building a solution to a problem that creates value.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="3."><li ><strong>Reach.</strong> Do a lot of people have this problem? Some problems, like searching for information, are shared by nearly everyone. Others, like online version control, are shared by a much smaller niche but still a significant amount of people. If a problem is shared by only a handful of people, it's probably not worth programming a solution.</li></ol>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Great Programmers Solve Important Problems</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The best programmers aren't simply the ones that write the best solutions: they're the ones that solve the best problems. The best programmers write kernels that allow billions of people to run other software, write highly reliable code that puts astronauts into space, write crawlers and indexers that organize the world's information. They make the right choices not only about how to solve a problem, but what problem to solve.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Life is Short</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Life is too short to solve unimportant problems. If you want to solve important problems, it's now or never. The greatest programmers only get to solve a relatively small amount of truly important problems. The sooner you get started working on those, the better.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Ignore Speed Limits</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you don't have the skills yet to solve important problems, reach out to those who do. To solve important problems, you need to develop a strong skill set. But you can do this much faster than you think. If you commit to solving important problems and then reach out to more committed programmers than you, I'm sure you'll find many of them willing to help speed you along your learning curve.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">Your steps are then: </p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >1. Make something people want. </li>
<li >2. Put it out there. </li>
<li >3. Survey your users. If less than 40% would be disappointed if your product disappeared, go back to step 1.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Only when you hit that 40% number(or something in that range) should you be comfortable that you've really made something people want.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">All the others did not have that same "must-have" rate. We launched Jobpic this summer at Demo Day. People definitely wanted it. But we didn't get good product/market fit. If we had surveyed our users, I bet less than 10% of them would report being disappointed if Jobpic disappeared.

<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >1. This is how you should be doing things.</li>
<li >2. You were not doing things this way.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That can frustrating. I've spent a few years now in the space and to realize you've been doing certain things wrong for a few <em>years</em> is...well...painful.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="seo-made-easy-lumps.html">SEO Made Easy: LUMPS</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 15, 2009 — </span>The best Search Engine Optimization(SEO) system I've come across comes from Dennis Goedegebuure, SEO manager at eBay. Dennis' system is called LUMPS. It makes SEO dead simple.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Just remember LUMPS:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li ><strong>L</strong>inks</li>
<li ><strong>U</strong>urls</li>
<li ><strong>M</strong>etadata</li>
<li ><strong>P</strong>age Content</li>
<li ><strong>S</strong>itemaps</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">These are the things you need to focus on in order to improve your SEO. You should also, of course, first know what terms you want to rank highly for. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">LUMPS is listed in order of importance to search engines. So links are most important, sitemaps are least important.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's break each one down a bit more.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Links</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">External links--links from domains other than your own--are most important. For external links, focus on 3 things, again listed in order of importance:</p>
</div></div>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li >Quality. A link from CNN.com is worth <a href="orders-of-magnitude.html">order(s) of magnitude</a> more than a link from my blog. A link from a related source, like from ESPN.com to a sports blog, would likely be better than from an unrelated source.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="2."><li >Quantity. Even though quality is most important, a lot of inbound links help.</li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="3."><li >Anchor Text. You want links with relevant anchor text. <a href="http://www.jellyfishart.com">Jellyfish tanks</a> is better than <a href="http://www.jellyfishart.com">click here</a>.</li></ol>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Your internal link structure is also important. Make sure your site repeatedly links to the pages you are optimizing for.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">External links are the most important thing you need for SEO. Internal links you can easily control, but it takes time to accumulate a lot of quality external links. Focus on creating quality content(or even better, build a User Generated Content site). People will link to interesting content.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">URL Structure</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The terms you are optimizing for should be in your urls. It's even better if they are in your domain. For instance, if I'm optimizing for "breck yunits", I've done a good job by having the domain name breckyunits.com. If I'm optimizing for the term "seo made easy", ideally I'd have that domain. But I don't, so having breckyunits.com/seo<em>made</em>easy is the next best thing. </p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Luckily, URL Structure is not just important, it's also relatively easy to do well and you can generally set up friendly URLs in an hour or so. I could explain how to do it with .htaccess and so forth, but there are plenty of articles out there with more details on that.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Metadata Content</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Your TITLE tags and META DESCRIPTIONS tags are important for 2 reasons. First, search engines will use the content in them to rank your pages. Second, when a user sees a search results page, the title and description tags are what the user sees. You need good copy that will increase the Click Through Rate. Think of your title and description tags as the Link Text and Description in an AdWords ad. Just as you'd optimize the AdWords ad, you need to optimize this "seo ad". Make the copy compelling and clear.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Like URL structure, you can generally set up a system that generates good meta and description tags relatively easily.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Page Content</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Content is king. If you've got the other 3 things taken care of and you have great content, you're golden. Not only will great content please your visitors, but it will likely be keyword rich which helps with SEO. Most importantly, it is much easier to get links to valuable, interesting content than to bad content. Figure out a way to get great content and the whole SEO process will work a lot better.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Sitemaps</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Sitemaps are not the most crucial thing you can do, but they help and are an easy thing to check off your list. Use Google Webmaster tools and follow all recommendations and submit links to your sitemaps.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Summary</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There you have it, SEO made easy! Just remember LUMPS.</p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="dont-flip-the-bozo-bit.html">Don't Flip the Bozo Bit</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 13, 2009 — </span>Do you "flip the bozo bit" on people? </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you don't know what that means, you probably do it unknowingly!</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">What it means</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you "flip the bozo bit" on someone you ignore everything they say or do. You flip the bozo bit on a person when they are wrong or make a mistake over and over again. Usually you flip the bozo bit unconsciously.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">An example</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You are writing a program with Bob. Bob constantly writes buggy code. You get frustrated by Bob's bugs and slowly start ignoring all the code he submits and start writing everything yourself. You've flipped the bozo bit!</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This is bad for everyone. Now you are doing more work, and Bob is becoming resentful because you are ignoring his ideas and work.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Alternatives to Flipping the Bozo Bit</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Instead of flipping the bozo bit, perhaps you could work with another person. If that's not possible, take a more constructive approach:</p>
</div></div>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li ><strong>Teach</strong>. Talk to Bob and figure out why he is making repeated mistakes. We all have large gaps in our education. If you've never been exposed to a concept, there's no reason why you should understand it. Try and find what it is Bob hasn't been exposed to yet, and help him learn it. </li></ol>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="2."><li ><strong>Change Roles</strong>. Maybe Bob should be working in another area. Find an area where you're the bozo and Bob's the expert. Let him work in that area, while you work in your area. He can even explain a thing or two to you.</li></ol>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Why We Flip the Bozo Bit</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It seems like a simple evolutionary trick to save time. If someone is right only 10% of the time, would it be faster to ignore every statement they made, or faster to analyze each statement carefully in case it's the 1 out of 10 statements that might be true? Seems like it would be faster to just ignore everything by flipping the bozo bit.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But this is a bad solution. The two presented above are better.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 11, 2009 — </span>Jason Fried from 37signals gave a great talk at startup school last month. At one point he said "software has no edges." He took a normal, everyday bottle of water and pointed out 3 features:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >1. The bottle held the water.</li>
<li >2. The lightweight plastic made it easy to carry, and you can tell how full it was by picking it up.</li>
<li >3. The clear bottle let you see how much was left and what was in it.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you added a funnel to help pour the water, that might be useful in 5% of cases, but it would look a little funny. Then imagine you attach a paper towel to each funnel for when you spill. Your simple water bottle is now a monstrosity. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The clear edges of physical products make it much harder for feature creep to happen. But in software feature creep happens, and happens a lot.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A proposal to fight feature creep</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How do you fight feature creep in software? Here's an idea: do not put each new feature request or idea on a to-do list. Instead, put them on an (un)features list.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">An (un)features list is a list of features you've consciously decided not to implement. It's a well maintained list of things that might seem cool, but would detract from the core product. You thought about implementing each one, but after careful consideration decided it should be an (un)feature and not a feature. Your (un)features list will also include features you built, but were only used by 1% of your customers. You can "deadpool" these features to the (un)features list. Your (un)features list should get as much thought, if not more, than your features list. It should almost certainly be bigger.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you have an idea or receive a feature request, there's a physical, OCD-like urge to do something with it. Now, instead of building it or putting it on a todo list, you can simply write it down on your (un)features list, and be done with it. Then maybe your water bottles will look more like water bottles.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This blog is powered by <a href="https://github.com/breck7/brecksblog">software</a> with an (un)features list.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 10, 2009 — </span>Employees and students receive deadlines, due dates, goals, guidelines, instructions and milestones from their bosses and teachers. I call these "arbitrary constraints". </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Does it really matter if you learn about the American Revolution by Friday? No. Is there a good reason why you must increase your sales this month by 10%, versus say 5% or 15%? No. Does it really matter if you get a 4.0 GPA? No.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But these constraints are valuable, despite the fact that they are arbitrary. <em>They help you get things done</em>. </p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Constraints Help You Focus</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Constraints, whether meaningful or not, simplify things and help you focus. We are simple creatures. Even the smartest amongst us need simple directions: green means go, red means stop, yellow means step on it. Even if April 15th is an arbitrary day to have your tax return filed, it is a simple constraint that gets people acting.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Successful People Constantly Set Constraints</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Successful people are good at getting things done. They focus well. Oftentimes they focus on relatively meaningless constraints. But they meet those constraints, however arbitrary. By meeting a lot of constraints, in the long run they hit enough of those non-arbitrary constraints to achieve success. Google is known for it's "OKR's"--objectives and key results--basically a set of arbitrary constraints that each employee sets and tries to hit.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Entrepreneurs Must Set Their Own Constraints</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you start a company, there are no teachers or bosses to set these constraints for you. This is a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because you get to choose constraints that are more meaningful to you and your interests. It's a curse because if you don't set these constraints, you can get fuddled. Being unfocused, <em>at times</em>, can be very beneficial. Having unfocused time is a great way to learn new things and come up with new ideas. However, to get things done you need to be focused. And the first step to get focused is to set some arbitrary constraints.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A Specific Example</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here are some specific constraints I set in the past week:</p>
</div></div>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li >Write 1 blog post per day.</li>
<li >Create blogging software in under 100 lines of code.</li>
<li >Have version 0.2 of blogging software done by 5pm yesterday.</li></ol>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All of these are mostly arbitrary. And I have not met all of them. But setting them has helped me focus.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">When You Don't Meet Your Constraints</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you don't meet your constraints, it's no big deal. They're largely arbitrary anyway. Even by just trying to meet your constraints, you learn a lot more. You are forced to think critically about what you are doing. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you don't meet some constraints, set new ones. Because you now have more experience, the new ones might be less arbitrary.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But the important thing is just having constraints in the first place.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<p class="scrollParagraph">Likewise, saving blogging for your old age makes no sense. There are two selfless reasons why you should start blogging now:</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 8, 2009 — </span>Finding experienced mentors and peers might be the most important thing you can do if you want to become a great programmer. They will tell you what books to read, explain the pros and cons of different languages, demystify anything that seems to you like "magic", help you when you get in a jam, work alongside you to produce great things people want, and challenge you to reach new heights.  </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Great coders travel in packs, just like great authors.  </p>

Even if you feel you are not qualified for one, apply anyway, and stress how you are smart, passionate, and the experience will come with time. If you don't get a programming job today, you can reapply in 6 months or 1 year when you have better skills. Here are six job sites to check out: Craigslist (<a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/cpg/">Computer Gigs</a>, <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eng/">Internet Engineers</a>, <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sof/">Software</a>, <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sad/">Systems</a>, <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/web/">Web Design</a>) <a href="http://jobs.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchboard.com/jobs/">CrunchBoard</a>, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/jobs">HackerNews</a>, <a href="http://www.redditjobs.com/">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://startuply.com/">Startuply</a>.</li>
<li ><strong>Take a programming class</strong>. My best tutors are my peers. People who I took a class or two with in college. We knew each other when computers were a big mystery to us, so we don't feel embarassed when we ask questions that may sound dumb. If you're currently in college, enroll in a programming class. Otherwise, look at local colleges' continuing education programs, community colleges, or professional classes. If you're in San Francisco, maybe look at <a href="http://www.academyx.com/">AcademyX</a>. Give <a href="http://unclasses.com">unclasses.com</a> a try. If you think classes cost too much, don't use that as an excuse until you've tried to negogiate a deal. Often someone will give you a class for free or greatly reduced price simply by explaining your situation. Other times maybe you can offer a service in return.</li>
<li ><strong>Attend a Meetup</strong>. I go to PHP and MySQL meetups frequently. <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> has thousands of programming meetups throughout the country. Go to one. Every month. You'll learn from the speaker, you'll meet other programmers, and you'll meet recruiters who will try to hire you if you still haven't gotten that job.  </li>
<li ><strong>Join <a href="http://github.com">Github</a></strong>. Github is the first <em>user friendly</em> collaborative development site for programmers. Once you get comfortable with it, you could be working alongside other programmers on open source projects in no time. I'll write a better tutorial on how to get started soon, but for now, just join and explore around. It may take you a month or two to "get it", so don't feel overwhelmed if you don't understand what's going on at first. You will eventually. And you'll start to find some great programmers to talk to.</li>
<li ><strong>Email Someone Directly</strong>. Email has been around for 35 years and it's still the favorite mode of communication for programmers. If you like someone's work, send them an email and ask for 1 or 2 tips. I've found when I email great programmers, their responses are usually short and to the point. That's not because they don't want to help, it's just that they're busy and use time effectively. Keep your emails brief and specific and they can be of great aid.  </li>
<li ><strong>Enlist a Friend</strong>. If you excercise with someone else, you burn 50% more calories on average. Likewise, if you learn programming with a friend, you'll learn 50% faster. That's a significant time savings. It's also more fun. You must have a friend who has a similar interest as you in programming. Why not suggest that you get serious about learning it together?   </li></ol>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Hopefully you'll find some of these tips useful. Feel free to email me if you need a first mentor (breck7 at google's email service). I'm not very good yet, but I may be able to help.   </p>

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="orders-of-magnitude.html">Orders of Magnitude</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 7, 2009 — </span>Do you think in Orders of Magnitude? You should.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you think in orders of magnitude you can quickly visualize how big a number is and how much effort it would take to reach it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Orders of magnitude is a way of grouping numbers. The numbers 5, 8 and 11 are all in the same order of magnitude. The numbers 95, 98 and 109 are in the same order of magnitude as well, but their order of magnitude is one order of magnitude greater than 5, 8, 11.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Basically, if you multiple a number by 10, you raise it one order of magnitude. If you've ever seen the scary looking notation 5x10^2, just take the number five and raise it 2 orders of magnitude (to 500).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Think of orders of magnitude as rough approximations. If you want the number 50 to be in the same order of magnitude as the number 10, you can say that "it's roughly in the same order of magnitude" or that "it's about half an order of magnitude bigger". Don't worry about being exact. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Orders of magnitude is a great system because generally there's a huge difference between 2 numbers in different orders of magnitude. Thus to cross from one order of magnitude to the next, a different type of effort is required than to simply increment a number. For example, if you run 2 miles each day and then decide to run one more, 3 total, it should be easy. But if you decided to run one more order of magnitude, 20 miles, it would take a totally new kind of effort. You'd have to train longer, eat differently, and so forth. To go from 2 to 3 requires a simple approach, just increase what you're doing a bit. To go from 2 to 20, to increase by an order of magnitude, requires a totally different kind of effort.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A Business Example</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Let's do a business example.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Pretend you started a business delivering pizza. Today you have five customers, make 5 pizzas a week, and earn $50 revenue per week. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You can keep doing what you're doing and slowly raise that to 6 customers, then 7 and so on. Or you can ask yourself, "How can I increase my business an order of magnitude?" </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Going from 5 to 50 will take a different type of effort than just going from 5 to 6. You may start advertising or you might create a "Refer a Customer, get a free pizza" promotion. You might have to hire a cook. Maybe lower your price by $2. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Imagine you do all those things and now have 50 customers. How do you get to 500? </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now you might need a few employees, television advertisements, etc. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>Growing a business is the process of focusing like a laser on the steps needed to reach the next order of magnitude.</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here are some more examples of orders of magnitude if it's still not clear:</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Bill Gates has approximately $50,000,000,000. Warren Buffett has $40,000,000,000. For Warren to match Bill, he merely has to make a few more great investments and hope Microsoft's stock price doesn't go up. He does not have to increase his wealth an order of magnitude. I on the other hand, have $5 (it was a good month). For me to become as rich as BillG, I have to increase my wealth 10 orders of magnitude. That means that I'd have 10 different types of hard challenges to overcome to match BillG's wealth.</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Going from $5 to $50 may mean just working a bit and could be accomplished in a day.</li>
<li >Going from $50 to $500 would mean working a few days.</li>
<li >Going from $500 to $5,000 might mean getting a job that pays more.</li>
<li >Going from $5,000 to $50,000 would mean getting a job that pays more, saving more, and doing that for a longer period.</li>
<li >Going from $50,000 to $500,000 might mean doing all that, plus making some good investments.</li>
<li >... and so forth.</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">More examples</h1>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >If your room is 200 square feet, the world is 13 orders of magnitude greater than your room.</li>
<li >Google indexes 10,000,000,000 pages. This site is 10 pages. There are 9 orders of magnitude more pages in the Google Index.</li>
<li >Facebook has 350 million users. Dropbox has 3 million. Facebook has 2 orders of magnitude more users.</li>
<li >The population of California is about 35 million. The population of the US is one order of magnitude bigger, about 300 million. The population of China is about 4 times that of the U.S. at 1,300,000, which is less than an order of magnitude difference.</li>
<li >Shaq is about 1 order of magnitude taller than a newborn, but besides that height is much more narrowly distributed. Everyone is within the same order of magnitude tall.</li></ul>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 6, 2009 — </span>Imagine you are eating dinner with 9 friends and you all agree to play Credit Card Roulette. Credit Card Roulette is a game where everyone puts their credit card in a pile and the server randomly chooses one and charges the whole meal to it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Imagine you are playing this game with your own friends. Pause for a second and picture it happening. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">...</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What did you see?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I bet you saw one person's card get picked and that person was sad and everyone else laughed.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Wrong!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This is <em>not what really happened</em>! In reality, despite the fact that you observed only one's person card getting picked, in reality <em>everyone's card got chosen</em>. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In reality, when you played the game, the world split into 10 paths, and every person's card got picked in one of those paths. You only observed one path, but trust me, there were 9 others. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This is a simple example of the many worlds law. You probably were not taught the many worlds law in school, which is a shame. It's one of the most important laws in the world. </p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>
</div></div>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >1. I love this game because I don't have a credit card</li>
<li >2. You can benefit greatly from understanding the many worlds law. Take solace in the fact that somewhere out there you won the lottery and are drinking a pina colada on your private island right now. </li>
<li >3. The many worlds law could very well be wrong. There could be just 1 world. There could be 42. I don't think about that much. There may be no god, but betting there is one has benefits.</li>
<li >4. I called it the many worlds "law" because I don't want to use the word theory or hypothesis. Theory and hypothesis are too linked in people's minds with uncertainty, and some ideas, like evolution and many worlds, have way too much supporting evidence to leave any room for uncertainty, in as much as we can be uncertain about something. </li>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 4, 2009 — </span>Do you want to become a great coder? Do you have a <strong>passion</strong> for computers but not a thorough understanding of them? If so, this post is for you. </p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Saying #1: 10,000 Hours</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There is a saying that it takes 10,000 hours of doing something to master it. </p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So, to master programming, it might take you 10,000 hours of being actively coding or thinking about coding. That translates to a consistent effort spread out over a number of years.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Saying #2: No Speed Limit</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There is another saying that I just <a href="https://sivers.org/kimo">read</a> which inspired me to write this, that says "there is no speed limit".</p>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In that post, Derek Sivers claims that a talented and generous guy named Kimo Williams taught him 2 years worth of music theory in five lessons. I have been learning to program for 2 years, and despite the fact that I've made great progress, my process has been slow and inefficient. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I did not have a Kimo Williams. But now that I know a bit, I'll try and emulate him and help you learn faster by sharing my top 12 lessons.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'll provide the tips first, then if you're curious, a little bit more history about my own process.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The 12 Tips</h1>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="1."><li ><strong>Get started</strong>. Do not feel bad that you are not an expert programmer yet. In 10,000 hours, you will be. All you need to do is start. Dedicate some time each day or week to checking things off this list. You can take as long as you want or move as fast as you want. If you've decided to become a great programmer, youve already accomplished the hardest part: planting the seed. Now you just have to add time and your skills will blossom. If you need any help with any of these steps, feel free to email me and Ill do my best to help.</li>
<li ><strong>Dont worry</strong>. Do not be intimated by how much you dont understand. Computers are still largely magic even to me. We all know that computers are fundamentally about 1s and 0s, but what the hell does that really mean? It took me a long time to figure it out--it has something to do with voltages and transistors. There are endless topics in computer science and endless terms that you won't understand. But if you stick with it, eventually almost everything will be demystified. So don't waste time or get stressed worrying about what you don't know. It will come, trust me. Remember, every great programmer at one time had NO IDEA what assembly was, or a compiler, or a pointer, or a class, or a closure, or a transistor. Many of them still dont! That's part of the fun of this subject--you'll always be learning.</li>
<li ><strong>Silicon Valley</strong>. Simply by moving to Silicon Valley, you have at least: 10x as many programmers to talk to, 10x as many programming job opportunities, 10x as many programming meetups, and so on. You don't have to do this, but it will make you move much faster. The first year of my programming career was in Boston. The second year was in San Francisco. I have learned at a much faster pace my second year.</li>
<li ><strong>Read books</strong>. In December of 2007 I spent a few hundred dollars on programming books. I bought like 20 of them because I had no idea where to begin. I felt guilty spending so much money on books back then. Looking back, it was worth it hundreds of times over. You will read and learn more from a good $30 paperback book than dozens of free blogs. I could probably explain why, but its not even worth it. The data is so very clear from my experience that trying to explain why it is that way is like trying to explain why pizza tastes better than broccoli: Im sure there are reasons but just try pizza and you'll agree with me.</li>
<li ><strong>Get mentors</strong>. I used to create websites for small businesses. Sometimes my clients would want something I didnt know how to do, simple things back then like forms. I used to search Google for the answers, and if I couldnt find them, I'd panic! Dont do that. When you get in over your head, ping mentors. They dont mind, trust me. Something that youll spend 5 hours panicking to learn will take them 2 minutes to explain to you. If you dont know any good coders, feel free to use me as your first mentor.</li>
<li ><strong>Object Oriented</strong>. This is the "language" the world codes in. Just as businessmen communicate primarily in English, coders communicate primarily in Object Oriented terms. Terms like classes and instances and inheritance. They were completely, completely, completely foreign and scary to me. Theyd make me sick to my stomach. Then I read a good book(Object Oriented PHP, Peter Lavin), and slowly practiced the techniques, and now I totally get it. Now I can communicate and work with other programmers.</li>
<li ><strong>Publish code</strong>. If you keep a private journal and write the sentence The car green is, you may keep writing that hundreds of times without realizing its bad grammar, until you happen to come upon the correct way of doing things. If you write that in an email, someone will instantly correctly you and you probably won't make the mistake again. You can speed up your learning <em>1-2 orders of magnitude</em> by sharing your work with others. Its embarrassing to make mistakes, but the only way to become great is to trudge through foul smelling swamp of embarrassment.</li>
<li ><strong>Use github</strong>. The term version control used to scare the hell out of me. Heck, it still can be pretty cryptic. But version control is crucial to becoming a great programmer. Every other developer uses it, and you can't become a great programmer by coding alone, so you'll have to start using it. Luckily, you're learning during an ideal time. Github has made learning and using version control much easier. Also, Dropbox is a great tool that your mom could use and yet that has some of the powerful sharing and version control features of something like git.</li>
<li ><strong>Treat yourself</strong>. Build things you think are cool. Build stuff you want to use. Its more fun to work on something you are interested in. Programming is like cooking, you don't know if what you make is good until you taste it. If something you cook tastes like dog food, how will you know unless you taste it? Build things you are going to consume yourself and you'll be more interested in making it taste not like dog food. </li>
<li ><strong>Write English</strong>. Code is surprisingly more like English than like math. Great code is easy to read. In great code functions, files, classes and variables are named well. Comments, when needed, are concise and helpful. In great code the language and vocabulary is not elitist: it is easy for the layman to understand. </li>
<li ><strong>Be prolific</strong>. You dont paint the Mona Lisa by spending 5 years working on 1 piece. You create the Mona Lisa by painting 1000 different works, one of them eventually happens to be the Mona Lisa. Write web apps, iPhone apps, Javascript apps, desktop apps, command line tools: as many things as you want. Start a small new project every week or even every day. You eventually have to strike a balance between quantity and quality, but when you are young the goal should be quantity. Quality will come in time. </li>
<li ><strong>Learn Linux</strong>. The command line is not user friendly. It will take time and lots of repetition to learn it. But again, its what the world uses, you'll need at least a basic grasp of the command line to become a great programmer. When you get good at the command line, its actually pretty damn cool. Youll appreciate how much of what we depend on today was written over the course of a few decades. And youll be amazed at how much you can do from the command line. If you use Windows, get CYGWIN! I just found it a few months ago, and it is much easier and faster than running virtualized Linux instances.</li></ol>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>That's it, go get started!</strong> </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Actually, I'll give you one bonus tip:</p>
<ol style="text-indent:0px;" start="13."><li ><strong>Contact me</strong>. My email address is breck7 at Google's mail service. Feel free to ping me for personal help along your journey, and I'll do my best to lend a hand.</li></ol>
<div class="scrollSection"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">My Story, briefly</h1>
</div></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Two years ago, in December 2007, I decided to become a great programmer. Before then, I had probably spent under 1,000 hours "coding". From 1996 to 2007, age 12 to age 23, I spent around 1,000 hours "coding" simple things like websites, MSDOS bat scripts, simple php functions, and "hello world" type programs for an Introduction to Computer Science class. Despite the fact that I have always had an enormous fascination with computers, and spent a ton of time using them, I was <em>completely clueless</em> about how they worked and how to really program.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">(If you're wondering why didn't I start coding seriously until I was 23 and out of college there's a simple and probably common reason: the whole time I was in school my goal was to be cool, and programming does not make you cool. Had I known I would never be cool anyway, I probably would have started coding sooner.)</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Finally in December 2007 I decided to make programming my career and #1 hobby. Since then I estimate I've spent 20-50 hours per week either coding or practicing. By practicing I mean reading books about computers and code, thinking about coding, talking to others, and all other related activities that are not actually writing code.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That means I've spent between 2,000-5,000 hours developing my skills. Hopefully, by reading these tips, you can move much faster than I have over the past 2 years.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 3, 2009 — </span>What would happen if instead of writing about subjects you understood, you wrote about subjects you didn't understand? Let's find out!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Today's topic is linear algebra. I know almost nothing about vectors, matrices, and linear algebra.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I did not take a Linear Algebra course in college. Multivariable calculus may have done a chapter on vectors, but I only remember the very basics: it's a size with a direction, or something like that.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I went to a Borders once specifically to find a good book to teach myself linear algebra with. I even bought one that I thought was the most entertaining of the bunch. Trust me, it's far from entertaining. Haven't made it much further than page 10.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I bet vectors, matrices, and linear algebra are important. In fact, I'm <em>positive</em> they are. But I don't know why. I don't know how to apply linear algreba in everyday life, or if that's something you even do with linear algebra.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I use lots of math throughout the day such as:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Addition/subtraction when paying for things</li>
<li >Multiplication when cooking for 6 roommates</li>
<li >Probability when deciding whether to buy cell phone insurance</li>
<li >Calculus when thinking about the distance needed to break fast while biking</li>
<li >Exponents and logs when analyzing traffic graphs and programming</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I have no idea when I should be using vectors, matrices, and other linear algebra concepts throughout the day.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There are lots of books that teach <em>how</em> to do linear algebra. But are there any that explain <em>why</em>?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Would everyone benefit from linear algebra just as everyone would benefit from knowing probability theory? Would I benefit? </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I don't know the answer to these questions. Fooled by Randomness revealed to me why probability is so incredibly important and inspired me to master it. Is there a similar book like that for linear algebra?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I guess when you write about what you don't know, you write mostly questions.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<div class="scrollSnippetContainer"><div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollTitle"><a href="fiction-or-nonfiction.html">Fiction or Nonfiction?</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 2, 2009 — </span>What books have changed your life? Seriously, pause for a few minutes and think about the question. I'll share my list in a moment, but first come up with yours.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Do you have your list yet? Writing it down may help. Try to write down 10 books that you think have most impacted your life. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Take all the time you need before moving on.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Are you done yet? Don't cheat. Write it down then continue reading.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Okay, at this point I'm assuming you've followed instructions and wrote down your list of 10 books. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now you have one more step. To the right of each book title, write "fiction" or "nonfiction". You can use the abbreviations "F" and "NF" if you wish.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You should now have a list that looks something like mine:</p>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >How to Read a Book - NF</li>
<li >Never Eat Alone - NF</li>
<li >Fooled by Randomness - NF</li>
<li >How to Win Friends and Influence People - NF</li>
<li >Snowball - NF</li>
<li >Influence - NF</li>
<li >Object Oriented PHP - NF</li>
<li >Life of Pi - F</li>
<li >Lord of the Flies - F</li>
<li >The Illiad - F</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, count the NF's. How many do you have? I have 7. So 7 out of the 10 books that I think have most impacted my life are non-fiction. Therefore, if I have to guess whether the next book I read that greatly impacts my life will be fiction or nonfiction, my guess is it will be nonfiction. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What's your list? Do you think the next book that will greatly impact your life will be fiction or non-fiction?</p>

<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Experience is what you get when you don't get what you want.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 2, 2009 — </span>How many times have you struggled towards a goal only to come up short? How many times have bad things happened to you that you wish hadn't happened? If you're like me, the answer to both of those is: a lot.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But luckily you always get something when you don't get what you want. You get experience. Experience is data. When accumulated and analyzed, it can be incredibly valuable.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">To be successful in life you need to have good things happen to you. Some people call this "good luck". Luck is a confusing term. It was created by people who don't think clearly. Forget about the term "luck". There is not "good luck" and "bad luck". Instead, "good things happen", and "bad things happen". Your life is a constant bombardment of things happening, good and bad. Occasionally, despite making bad decisions steadily, some people have good things happen to them. But in most cases to have good things happen to you, you've got to make a steady stream of good decisions.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You've got to see patterns in the world and recognize cause and effect. You've got to think through your actions and foresee how each action you take will affect the chances of "good things happening" versus "bad things happening" down the line. </p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When you're fresh out of the gate, it's hard to make those predictions. You just don't have any data so you can't analyze cause and effect appropriately. But once you're out there attempting things, even if you screw up or don't get what you want, you get experience. You get data to use to make better decisions in the future.</p><p class="scrollViewSource">

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 2, 2009 — </span>Decided to blog again. I missed it. Writing publicly, even when you only get 3 readers, two of which are bots and the other is your relative, is to the mind what exercise is to the body. It's fun and feels good; especially when you haven't done it in a while.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Also decided to go old school. No Wordpress or Tumblr, Blogger or Posterous. Instead, I'm writing this on pen and paper. Later I'll type it into HTML using Notepad++, vim, or equivalent(EDIT: after writing this I coded my own, simple blogging software called <a href="http://github.com/breck7/brecksblog">brecksblog</a>). It will just be text and links. Commenting works better on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">hackernews</a>, <a href="http://digg.com">digg</a>, or <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> anyway.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Hopefully these steps will result in better content. Pen and paper make writing easier and more enjoyable, so hopefully I'll produce more. And the process of typing should serve as a filter. If something sucks, I won't take the time to type it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm writing to get better at communicating, thinking, and just for fun. If anyone finds value in these posts, that's an added bonus.</p>
