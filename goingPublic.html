<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">November 5, 2022 â€” </span>On September 5th, 2022, just 61 days ago, I offered to give YCombinator 7% of my startup, <a href="https://publicdomaincompany.com">Public Domain Publishing Inc.</a>, if they would handle taking us public. In my twenty years of startups, I have never seen a black swan like us.</p>

I put it in a waterproof bag at <a href="https://www.wetnwildhawaii.com/">Wet'n'Wild</a> Oahu that due to user error was filled with water all day.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">YCombinator took too long to decide and so on September 21st, 2022, I signed with someone else to take us public, the best in the world at this, recommended to me by a friend at Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">In September YCombinator went from being my best sounding board to a complete antagonist, who would go on to ban me from many online communities I helped foster, helped coordinate the theft of $50,000 from our company, and has censored me relentlessly from the link sharing communities it controls.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">I am perplexed and hurt by YCombinator's recent behavior. I assume there's a rational explanation such as 1) pushing me to my limits for my own training and benefits 2) just fumbling because they also have never seen a startup like ours 3) being mad that I was right about Covid and the vaccines and they were wrong 4) just PG, the creator of the front page of the Internet, having a good troll.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>Sidenote: If you are reading this and perplexed by the term YCombinator, let me just say it is the greatest organization for startups I have ever seen and they are responsible for 80% of my success and I highly recommend you <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">apply</a>. But I digress.</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Sadly it looks like this will end up in court. The bad news is that's a distraction. The good news is discovery is going to be entertaining as fuck. I've got some stories.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Anyway, I am hoping that YCombinator:</p>
<ul ><li >Immediately restores my access to all of the forums and email groups that they kicked me out of.</li>
<li >Immediately overhaul how flagging is done on HackerNews and Reddit in a way that the men and women who have died for American values would be proud.</li>
<li >Change their theme color from Orange to rgb(11,8,86) everyday on that year.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now, back to coding.</p>
