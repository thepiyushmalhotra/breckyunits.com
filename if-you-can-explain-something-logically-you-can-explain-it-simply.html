<div class="scrollColumns" style="column-width:35ch;column-count:2;max-width:90ch;">
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Is there any subject which cannot be explained simply?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>No.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>What about quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, or rocket science? Surely these cannot be explained simply.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>Any and every subject that can be explained logically, can also be explained simply.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>So you are saying that even I can become an expert at quantum mechanics?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>No. I am saying that every logical thing there is to learn in quantum mechanics can be explained simply. This holds for all subjects. However, that does not mean that every person can master every subject. Only people that master the basic building blocks of human knowledge can master any subject.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>What are the basic building blocks of human knowledge?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>First, the ones you learn early on: reading, writing, and arithmetic. Then, a few you are not forced to learn: probability, statistics, evolution and psychology.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Why do I have to learn probability, statistics, evolution and psychology?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>Because these subjects explain 99% of what you see in the world. You need to learn probability and statistics to understand subjects like chemistry, physics, and engineering. You need to understand evolution and psychology to understand subjects like history, economics, government and religion. You need to know probability and statistics to understand these latter subjects as well. Thus, probability and statistics is as core to learning as reading, writing, and arithmetic.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>I took a prob/stat course in high school. Is that good enough?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>Probably not. After you took your reading and writing classes in elementary school, did you stop reading and writing or did you start practicing these skills everyday? You continued to use and practice them, right? Did you continue to practice your prob/stat skills? You should.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>You're wrong. I've mastered probability and statistics, evolution, and psychology, and there are still subjects I can't find simple explanations for.</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>I'm not wrong. You just need to look in the right places. You probably won't find simple explanations in school. Schools are in the business of making learning seem complex and expensive. Better places to search for simple explanations: üåé Online. Sites like <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="http://www.ted.com/">Ted</a>, Wikipedia and Google. üìö In books. Browse around Barnes & Noble or Borders. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è From a friend. Find someone that knows the subject well and ask them to teach you.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" class="scrollChat scrollChatLeft"><span>Do I need to master the building blocks to be successful in life?</span></div><div style="text-align: right;" class="scrollChat scrollChatRight"><span>No. But you need to know them if you want to be able to learn any subject.</span></div>
