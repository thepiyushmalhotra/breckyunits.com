Can we quantify intelligence? Yes.

{Intelligence}(P) = \frac{\text{Accuracy}(P)}{\text{Size}(P)}

Intelligence(P) = Accuracy(P) / Size(P)

Program P is a bit vector that can make a bit vector (Predictions) that attempts to predict a bit vector of actual measurements (Reality).

Accuracy(P) is the sum of the XNOR of the Predictions vector with the Reality vector.

Intelligence(P) is equal to Accuracy(P) divided by Size(P).

***

If programs A and B are the same size, the more accurate program is more intelligent.

If they have the same accuracy, the smaller program is more intelligent.
