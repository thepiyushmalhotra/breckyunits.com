<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 29, 2024 ‚Äî </span>A child draws.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You take his paper.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He screams.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">His scream is just: you stole his property.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You give the paper back.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He stops screaming.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You copy his drawing on your own paper.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He smiles.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">His smile is just: he feels his work is appreciated, and he can learn from your version.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Ideas and property could not be more different.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Ideas cannot be stolen. Property can be.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Copying ideas helps, not hurts.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Children understand these obvious truths.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Children learn what is true from nature.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But teenagers turn from nature and start learning "truth" from the popular kids.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This allows for some strange diseases to spread across our civilization.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Intellectual Property Delusion Disease</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Intellectual Property Delusion Disease(IPDD) is a neurological disease most contagious in the United States, but afflicting countless people throughout the world.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The brain of someone infected with IPDD cannot deduce the obvious truth that copyrights and patents are the exact opposite of property rights.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">They cannot see that atoms are scarce and improved by assignment and ideas are the opposite.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Symptoms</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Symptoms of IPDD include:</p>
<ul ><li >the appearance of tiny round spots, often found on the foot, that look like this: ¬©</li>
<li >compulsive tendencies, such as insisting that a "license" accompany every piece of information.</li>
<li >trouble pronouncing phrases, saying "All Rights Reserved" when they mean "Your Rights Restricted."</li>
<li >paranoia that someone will "steal their ideas" accompanied by outbursts of "Patent Pending" or "FBI Warning" at their customers</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People with IPDD also suffer from deep, grandiose delusions like that they created:</p>
<ul ><li >a widget more important than the wheel</li>
<li >a song better than all of Beethoven's</li>
<li >a formula more intelligent than all of Einstein's</li></ul>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Prognosis</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">IPDD is deadly to individuals. IPDD often leads to the long term intellectual malnourishment of a person causing them to may make fatal health decisions.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">At a societal level, IPDD is a significant long term burden on economies. Holding all else equal, countries with low rates rates of IPDD infection have significantly faster innovation and more equal wealth distribution.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Treatment</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Luckily people can be cured of IPDD, no matter how old they are or advanced their infection.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The best medicine for curing IPDD is exposure to honest information and a long walk in the woods.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It is important to be careful when attempting to heal someone with IPDD too quickly.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I once told an infected Congressman that since they made everything someone writes "protected", they should also "protect" the air someone exhales.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was hoping this perspective might cure him of his affliction.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Instead, his face lit up, he pulled out his phone and told me he had to text his "Intellectual Property" Liar to try and patent his new idea for a machine that could add licenses to air molecules.</p>
