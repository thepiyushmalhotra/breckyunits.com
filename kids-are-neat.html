<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 25, 2010 ‚Äî </span>Maybe I'm getting old, but I'm starting to think the best way to "change the world" isn't to bust your ass building companies, inventing new machines, running for office, promoting ideas, etc., but to simply raise good kids. Even if you are a genius and can invent amazing things, by raising a few good kids their output combined can easily top yours. Nerdy version: you are a single core cpu and can't match the output of a multicore machine.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm not saying I want to have kids anytime soon. I'm just realizing after spending time with my family over on Cape Cod, that even my dad, who is a harder worker than anyone I've ever met and has made a profound impact with his work, can't compete with the output of 4 people (and their potential offspring), even if they each work only 1/3 as hard, which is probably around what we each do. It's simple math.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So the trick to making a difference is to sometimes slow down, spend time raising good kids, and delegate some of the world saving to them.</p>
