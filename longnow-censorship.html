<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">October 20, 2022 â€” </span>For over 30 days I've waited patiently for <a href="https://longnow.org/">LongNow Foundation</a>, operator of <a href="https://longbets.org/">LongBets.org</a>, to publish my prediction on cancer. For some reason they have not done so. So I am publishing it publicly to my git backed blog so we have it confirmed on the blockchain.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="longNowDm.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="longNowDm.png" width="1308" height="1516" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">After I tried to publish it via the website and had a problem, the LongNow foundation was extremely quick to "DM" me on Twitter, then went dark.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm not sure why they won't publish this one. I have been a LongNow member for many years. I even have one of those stupid metal membership cards.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I have paid for and made 2 public predictions. My first is a <a href="https://longbets.org/793/">prediction about programming languages</a>. My second is about an upcoming <a href="https://longbets.org/855/">medical disaster</a> in the United States.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Anyway, my prediction is below, written in <a href="https://scroll.pub/">Scroll</a>:</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">What is your prediction?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The cancer fatality rate in the United States will fall by 50% in 5 years.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">Why?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">CancerDB.com is a public domain CSV about every cancer cure.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It is simple a large spreadsheet, perhaps 100,000 rows long, by ~1,000 columns (so 100,000,000 cells).</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Every cancer researcher on earth will be able to instantly download it and contribute to it</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All cancer patients and their families will be able to instantly download it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It will update in real time as research is done throughout the world.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It uses the same underlying source code as PLDB.io, which is having a similar effect on programming languages.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Hundreds of cures are just a few tweaks away from saving many, many lives. CancerDB will accelerate the work of cancer researchers.</p>
