<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 16, 2009 ‚Äî </span>If you combine Paul Graham's "make something people want" advice with Sean Ellis' <a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/sean-ellis-interview">product-market fit advice</a> (you have product-market fit when you survey your users and at least 40% of them would be disappointed if your product disappeared tomorrow), you end up with a possibly even simpler, more specific piece of advice:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Make something 40% of your users must have</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Your steps are then:</p>
<ul ><li >1. Make something people want.</li>
<li >2. Put it out there.</li>
<li >3. Survey your users. If less than 40% would be disappointed if your product disappeared, go back to step 1.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Only when you hit that 40% number(or something in that range) should you be comfortable that you've really made something people want.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Does this advice work? I think it would for 3 reasons.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">I made a list of my "must have" products and they are all largely successful. I suggest you try this too. It's a good exercise.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">#3 The Only "Must Have" Product I Built was the Biggest Success</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've worked on a number of products over the past 3 years.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">One of them I can tell you had a "I'd be disappointed if this disappeared" rate of over 40%. We sold that site.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All the others did not have that same "must-have" rate. We launched Jobpic this summer at Demo Day. People definitely wanted it. But we didn't get good product/market fit. If we had surveyed our users, I bet less than 10% of them would report being disappointed if Jobpic disappeared. Our options are to change the product to achieve better product/market fit, or go forward with an entirely new product that will be a must have.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Concluding thoughts</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I don't know if this advice will work. But I'm going to try it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Startup advice can be both exhilarating and demoralizing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">On the plus side, good advice can drastically help you. At the same time, if it's really good advice that means two things:</p>
<ul ><li >1. This is how you should be doing things.</li>
<li >2. You were not doing things this way.</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That can frustrating. I've spent a few years now in the space and to realize you've been doing certain things wrong for a few <em>years</em> is...well...painful.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But you laugh it off and keep chugging along.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Notes</h1>
<ul ><li >Thanks Nivi for the great Venture Hacks interview!</li>
<li >Users/Customers refer to people who use your site regularly or buy from you. This is not "visitors". Generally a much lower percentage than 40% of visitors become users or customers. The 40% refers to the people who have made it through your funnel and have become users or customers.</li>
<li >I used customers and users interchangeably. For non-tech businesses, you can just use "customer" each time.</li>
<li >Thanks to <a href="http://www.bigorangehousestudios.com">Ben</a>, <a href="http://www.jellyfishart.com">Alex Andon</a>, and <a href="http://andrewkitchell.blogspot.com/">Andrew Kitchell</a> for feedback.</li>
<li >Another piece of startup advice that didn't "click" until recently: <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/good-question-the-eight-best-questions-we-got-while-raising-venture-capital/">Roelof Botha's 7 deadly sins advice</a>.</li></ul>
