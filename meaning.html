<p class="scrollParagraph">"I'll give you this library," the billionaire said, sweeping his arms up toward the majestic ceiling.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Or...you can have this scroll," he said, pointing down at a stick of paper on a table, tied with a red ribbon.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Thomas said nothing.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He kept his eyes locked on the billionaire's.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He had prepared for moments like this.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">Don't flinch.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Don't look away.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Be comfortable with silence.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Think.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">He knew he was going to be challenged with something today.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He just didn't know what.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now he knew.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">I have to get this right.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Obviously choose the library, right?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The real estate and art in this place are worth billions!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's the biggest personal library in the world!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It has every book ever published.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Every paper ever written.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Every song ever recorded.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Every movie ever filmed.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Shannon would take the library, right?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Think of all that information!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The collective work of a hundred billion humans over ten thousand years.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Ten trillion human-years of effort!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">With that much information, I could solve the complexity of the universe!</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The complexity of the universe.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Hmmm.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What did Wolfram discover about complexity?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Infinite complexity can arise from simple rules.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Simple rules.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Simple rules.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Simple rules...that could fit on a piece of paper.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Holy sh**.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Did he discover simple rules to our universe?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Did he invent a language that solves both quantum mechanics and gravity?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That has to be it.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But EVERYONE would choose the library.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">Thomas sat in his car in a beach parking lot and stared across the bay to the end of the cape.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First he saw the smoke, then the flames, and then the humongous rocket rise off the ground.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It gained speed as it rose into the sky, carrying his mentor and the rest of its crew on their journey to Mars.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When the rocket was out of sight, Thomas looked down at his lap.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He untied the red ribbon and unrolled the scroll.</p>
