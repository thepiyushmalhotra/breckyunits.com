<p class="scrollParagraph">A famous celebrity passes away and wakes up on a beach.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Welcome to the Afterplace", says a man in white.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He extends his hand and helps her to her feet.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"You must be hungry. Let me show you to the Omni Restaurant."</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">They walk from the water to an enormous restaurant.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The entire front of the restaurant is a glass wall facing the ocean.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The restaurant appears to extend endlessly in both directions.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A sliding glass door opens and they walk inside.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The ceilings are a hundred feet tall.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Even though countless people are dining, the restaurant is so large that it is quiet and uncrowded.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Please have a seat," he says, gesturing to a table with his hand.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"At the Omni Restaurant, you can order any dish ever invented by human civilization."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Whatever you want, just speak it into your table."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She sits down and says "Portobello mushrooms please."</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Suddenly, on the back wall, a hole five feet in diameter opens up.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then, flying out of the hole comes a silver platter.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The platter hovers over her table then gently floats down.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">On it is a perfectly grilled Portobello mushroom.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="omni.png" target="_blank"  ><img src="omni.png" width="930" height="991" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The former celebrity smiles, grabs the fork and knife, and takes her first bite.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Oh my god. This is the best Portobello mushroom I've ever tasted", she says.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The man nods his head, turns and leaves her to her meal.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After her meal she explores the grounds.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Eventually she tires and spends the night in a luxurious hammock.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The next morning she returns to the Omni Restaurant.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Bacon and eggs please," she says.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">'COMBINATIONS NOT ALLOWED,' a robotic voice says back.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A few people turn to look.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Her face crunches.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Portobello mushroom please," she says.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>Whew</em>, she thinks.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>Delicious. The same as yesterday.</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Her face relaxes.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>Is it <strong>exactly</strong> the same?</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Her face crunches again.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After another day exploring the grounds, she returns to the Omni Restaurant for dinner.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Filet Mignon please."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">'FILET MIGNON IN USE,' the robot voice responds.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People look.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Her face crunches.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Umm...ummm...lobster please"</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A hole appears in the wall.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Her face relaxes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A silver platter carrying a deep-red lobster lands in front of her.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Butter please"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">'CUSTOMIZATIONS NOT ALLOWED'.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Day 3 is off to a bad start.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Bacon please."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">'BACON IN USE.'</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Eggs please."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">'EGGS IN USE.'</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Peanut butter please."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">'PEANUT BUTTER IN USE.'</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Many eyes are on her.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Her face crunches.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then her face turns red.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She clenches her fists and stands up.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She looks at other people's tables.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She sees countless varieties of chips, candy bars, and cereals.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She also sees for the first time that the other diners are malnourished.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>Screw this!</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She storms to the back wall.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Someone orders a meal and a hole opens.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She dives through.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She lands on her hands and knees.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then she stands up and looks around.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"What the?!"</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There is no kitchen and no cooks.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There is nothing at all on this side of the wall.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She rubs her eyes in disbelief as she watches dish after dish materialize from nothing then fly out through a hole in the wall.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Suddenly she feels a tap on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"What are you doing back here?," asks the man in white.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"What am <em>I</em> doing back here? What am <em>I</em> doing back here? What are <em>YOU</em> doing back here?"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"People out front are <em>malnourished</em>."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"They can't order combinations. They can't customize their orders. And they can't eat something if someone else is eating it."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"And now I see that the physics of the Afterplace means all of the rules of the Omni Restaurant <em>don't make any sense</em>!"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"I <em>DEMAND</em> you take me to the being who designed this place."</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"That will not be a problem."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"If you will just follow me."</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">She follows him back to the front of the restaurant.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">They walk for miles past tables and tables of diners.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Finally the man in white comes to a stop.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In front of him, eating a bowl of cereal, is a man in a Vicuna suit.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Here sits the Omni Restaurant's creator," he gestures with his hand.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Stan?! It can't be Stan!"</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"You know him?"</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Of course!"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"He's my copyright lawyer!"</p>
