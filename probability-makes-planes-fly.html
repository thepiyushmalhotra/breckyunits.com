<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 18, 2012 ‚Äî </span>My whole life I've been trying to understand how the world works. How do planes fly? How do computers compute? How does the economy coordinate?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Over time I realized that these questions are all different ways of asking the same thing: how do complex systems work?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The past few years I've had the opportunity to spend thousands of hours practicing programming and studying computers. I now understand, in depth, one complex system. I feel I can finally answer the general question about complex systems with a very simple answer.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Compounded Probability Makes Complex Systems Work</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There is no certainty in life or in systems, but there is probability, and probability compounds.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We can combine the high probability that wheels roll, with the high probability that wood supports loads, to build a wooden chariot that has a high probability of carrying things from point A to point B, which has a high probability of giving us more time to innovate, and so on and so forth...</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Everything is built off of probability. You are reading this because of countless compounded probabilities like:</p>
<ul ><li >There is a high probability that your Internet connection works</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my web server is responding to connections</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my web server's disk works</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my web software works and will handle this post</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my Internet connection works</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my text editor won't fail as I write this</li>
<li >There is a high probability that my laptop works</li>
<li >There is a high probability that the CPU in my laptop consistently adds numbers in the registers correctly</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Complex systems consist of many, many simple components with understood probabilities stitched together.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How does a plane fly? The most concise and accurate answer isn't about aerodynamics or lift, it's about probabilities. A plane is simply a huge system of compounded probabilities.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How does a bridge stay up? The answer is not about physics, it's about compounded probabilities.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How do computers work? Compounded probability.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">How do cars work? Compounded probability.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The economy? Compounded probability.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Medicine? Compounded probability.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's probability all the way down.</p>
