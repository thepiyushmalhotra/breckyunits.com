The RIGHT STUFF

Kaia grabbed Pemma,
on the walk home from school,
and said--"Look at that!
That looks cool!"

Pemma looked and saw
a sign on a door.
It said "RED STUFF,
Now sold in our store!"

***

Into the shop,
The two sisters went,
They put their money on the counter,
every last cent.

***

"One can of RED STUFF, please,"
said Kaia to the clerk.
"One can of RED STUFF," he said back
"Do you know how it works?"

***

[Image Omitted]

"It says on the label"
'ATTENTION! You don't need to think
when you have got
RED STUFF ENERGY DRINK'

Sister and sister continued
on their way
And soon came to the playground,
where they stopped to play

***

[Image Omitted]

Kaia opened the can
And brought it to her lips
Then passed it to Pemma
Who took her own sip

***

[Image Omitted]

"Time to fly!" shouted Kaia
And she jumped on the swing
While Pemma ran over
to the monkey rings

***

[Image Omitted]

Kaia pumped her legs
Like a good swinging flyer
She had never pumped so hard
She had never gone higher

***

[Image Omitted]

And Pemma on the rings
Made it all the way across
She had tried that before
But always had lost

***

[Image Omitted]

Finally they got tired
And Kaia said "That's enough"
As they walked home they said
"We love RED STUFF"

The next morning at breakfast
Kaia thought of a plan.
"Mom, some kids get an allowance.
Do you think we can?"

***

[Image Omitted]

"Okay kids, here is the deal.
If your homework is done and your bed is made,
If your room is clean.
Do all that and you'll get paid"

***

[Image Omitted]

For many days
the kids did their chores and behaved
They got their allowances
and their allowances they saved

***

Finally one day
Kaia raised both of her hands
"Pemma we now have enough,"
"FOR 10 CANS!"

***

[Image Omitted]

"Ten cans of RED STUFF please"
This was quite a lot
But they had the money
So that's what they got

***

[Image Omitted]

Back to the Swings
Back to the Rings
They drank the RED STUFF
And did all the things

***

[Image Omitted]

Then they got tired
And sat on a tree
Drank another RED STUFF
And jumped up with glee

***

[Image Omitted]

"It's my turn on the rings!"
Pemma shouted very loud
"No it's my turn"
Kaia shouted back as loud as a crowd

***

[Image Omitted]

They struggled and struggled
And then Pemma ran
But Kaia followed her
Predicting her plan

***

[Image Omitted]

"This is my swing!"
Pemma screamed, and grabbed one
of the chains
"No its my swing!"
Kaia screamed back, as it started to rain.

***

[Image Omitted]

They tugged and they tugged
And said things to hurt
Then the chains snapped
And they fell to the dirt

***

[Image Omitted]

Both started crying
Just as their mother came around
"What happend?" she asked
Then she saw the cans on the ground.

***

[Image Omitted]

"Did you drink all of these?",
The kids nodded their heads.
"Uh huh. Yes we did",
They both said

***

[Image Omitted]

"Well, you drank the wrong stuff
And now you can see
That wasn't very wise
What you need is GOOD ENERGY"

***

[Image Omitted]

"Now its time for a bath
To take a nice soak.
And your next allowance will pay for
the swing that you broke"

***

[Image Omitted]

Later that month after a healthy breakfast,
Kaia again had a plan
"Back to the playgound!"
She said, and they ran

***

[Image Omitted]

On the swings Kaia swung higher than ever
And Pemma did the rings easy enough
"We don't need energy drinks Pemma."
We just need to eat The RIGHT STUFF"

***

THE END
