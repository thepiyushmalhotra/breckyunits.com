<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">November 16, 2022 ‚Äî </span>I dislike the term <em>first principles thinking</em>. It's vaguer than it needs to be. I present an alternate term: <strong>root thinking</strong>. It is shorter, more accurate, and contains a visual:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure"><a href="rootThinking.svg" target="_blank"  ><img src="rootThinking.svg" width="500" height="500" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">Sometimes we get something wrong near the root which limits our late stage growth. To reach new heights, we have to backtrack and build up from a different point.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All formal systems can be represented as trees<a href="#note1" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">First Principles</a> are simply the nodes at the root.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Root thinking becomes more valuable as current growth slows</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Technology grows very fast along its trendy branches. But eventually growth slows: there are always ceilings to the current path. As growth begins to slow, the ROI becomes higher for looking back for a path not taken, closer to the root, that could allow humans to reach new heights.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Root thinking isn't as valuable when growth is rapid</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If everyone practiced <em>root thinking</em> all the time we would get nowhere. It's hard to know the limits to a current path without going down it. Perhaps we only need 1 in 100, perhaps even fewer, to research and reflect on the current path and see if we have some better choices. I haven't invested much thought yet to what the ideal ratio is, if there is even one.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">On second thought, I think this idea is bad. The representation of your principles-axioms-agents-types-etc rounds to irrelevant. Infinitely better to spend time making sure you have the correct collection of first principles than worrying about representing them as a "tree" so you can have a visual. It's knowing what the principles are and how they interact that matters most, not some striving for the ideal representation syntax. This post presents a bad idea, but I'll leave it up as a reminder that sometimes I'm dead wrong.</p>
