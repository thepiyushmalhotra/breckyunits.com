<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 22, 2021 ‚Äî </span>Today I'm launching the beta of something new called <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll">Scroll</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've been reading the newspaper everyday since I was a kid. I remember I'd have my feet on the ground, my body tilted at an angle and my body weight pressed into the pages on the counter. I remember staring intently at the pages spread out before me. World news, local news, sports, business, comics. I remember the smell of the print. The feel of the pages. The ink that would be smeared on my forearms when I finished reading and stood back up straight. Scroll has none of that. But it does at least have the same big single page layout.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Scroll brings back <em>some</em> of the magic of newspapers.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In addition to the layout, Scroll has two important differences from existing static publishing software.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">First, Scroll is built for public domain sites and <em>only</em> public domain sites. Builders of Scroll will spend 100% of the time building for the amazing creators who understand and value the public domain.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Second, Scroll is a <a href="https://treenotation.org">Tree Language</a>. Unlike Markdown, Scroll is easily extensible. We can create and combine thousands of new sub languages to help people be more creative and communicate more effectively.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've had fun building Scroll so far and am excited to start working on it with others.</p>
