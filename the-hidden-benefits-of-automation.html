<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 17, 2010 ‚Äî </span>If you automate a process which you repeat <em>Y</em> times, that takes <em>X</em> minutes, what would your payoff be?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Payoff = <em>XY</em> minutes saved, right?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Surprisingly I've found that is almost never the case. Instead, the benefits are almost always greater than <em>XY</em>. In some cases, much greater. The benefits of automating a process are greater than the sum of the process' parts.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Actual Payoff = <em>XY minutes saved + E</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What is E? It's the extra something you get from not having to waste time and energy on XY.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">An Example</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Last year I did a fair amount of consulting work I found via craigslist. I used to check the Computer Gigs page for a few different cities, multiple times per day. I would check about 5 cities, spending about 2 minutes on each page, about 3 times per day. Thus, I'd spend 30 minutes a day just checking and evaluating potential leads.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I then wrote a script that aggregated all of these listings onto one page(including the contents so I didn't have to click to a new page to read a listing). It also highlighted a gig if it met a certain criteria that I had found to be promising. The script even automated a lot of the email response I would write to each potential client.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It cut my "searching time" down to about 10 minutes per day. But then something happened: I suddenly had more time and energy to focus on the <em>next aspect</em> of the problem: getting hired. It wasn't long before I was landing more than half the gigs I applied to, even as I raised my rates.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I think this is where the unexpected benefits come from. The E is the extra energy you'll have to focus on other problems once you don't have to spend so much time doing rote work.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Automate. Automate. Automate</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Try to automate as much as possible. The great thing about automation is that once you automate one task you'll have more time to automate the next task. Automation is a great investment with compounding effects. Try to get a process down to as few steps or keystrokes as possible(your ideal goal is zero keystrokes). Every step you eliminate will pay off more than you think.</p>
