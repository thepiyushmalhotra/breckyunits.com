<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 2, 2010 ‚Äî </span>My room was always messy. Usually because clothes were strewn everywhere On the floor, on the couch, anywhere there was a surface there was a pile of clothes. Dirty, clean, or mostly-clean scattered about.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I tried a dresser. I tried making a system where I had spaces for each type of clothing: shirts, pants, etc. Nothing worked.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then a friend saw my room and quipped, "Duh. You have too many clothes. Let's get rid of most of them."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So we did. About 75% of my clothes were packed up in garbage bags and sent off to the Salvation Army that day.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Ever since, my room has been at least 5x cleaner on average.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Almost always, there is one simple change you can make that will have <i>drastic</i> effects. This change is called <b>the least you can do</b>.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I had a website that was struggling to earn money even with a lot of visitors. I added AdSense and almost nothing happened. Then I moved the AdSense to a different part of the page and it suddenly made 5x more money. A week later I changed the colors of the ad and it suddenly made 2x as much money. Now the site makes 10x as much money and I barely did anything.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">These are trivial examples, but the technique works on real problems as well.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The key is to figure out what the "least you can do" is.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You can discover it by working harder or smarter:</p>
<ul ><li ><strong>The hard way.</strong> You can try a ton of things, go through a to-do list dozens of items long, and hope you hit upon it.</li>
<li ><strong>The smart way.</strong> You can invest time learning instead of doing. Reading books, learning new math or programming techniques, talking to other people, thinking critically, etc. You'll then have a much better hunch at what the "least you can do is".</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In reality you need to do things both ways. But try to put extra effort into doing things the smart way, and see where it takes you.</p>

<ul ><li >Thanks to <a href="http://massbeacon.com">Conor</a> for providing feedback.</li>
<li >I never shop for clothes. Once a year, maybe twice. The reason I had so many was because I never got rid of any clothes.</li>
<li >This AdSense site doesn't make a ton of money, but it now makes enough to pay all my server bills, which is nice.</li>
<li >Finding the least you can do is kind of like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a>. You are trying to find the smallest change you can make to turn the status quo into an improved version.</li>
<li >Another relevant computer science topics is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem">The longest common subsequence problem</a>.</li></ul>
