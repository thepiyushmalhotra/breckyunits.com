<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">August 23, 2010 ‚Äî </span>Your most recent experiences effect you the most. Reading this essay will effect you the most today but a week from now the effect will have largely worn off.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Experiences have a half-life. The effect decays over time. You might watch Almost Famous, run out to buy a drumset, start a band, and then a month later those drums could be gathering dust in your basement. You might read Shakespeare and start talking more lyrically for a week.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Newer experiences drown out old ones. You might be a seasoned Rubyist and then read an essay espousing Python and suddenly you become a Pythonista.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All genres of experiences exhibit the recency effect. Reading books, watching movies, listening to music, talking with friends, sitting in a lecture--all of these events can momentarily inspire us, influence our opinions and understanding of the world, and alter our behaviors.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Taking Advantage of the Recency Effect</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you believe in the recency effect you can see the potential benefit of superstitious behavior. For instance, I watched "The Greatest Game Ever Played", a movie about golf, and honest to god my game improved by 5 strokes the next day. A year later when I was a bit rusty, I watched it again and the effect was similar(though not as profound). When I want to write solid code, I'll read some quality code first for the recency effect.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you want to do great work, set up an inspiring experience before you begin. It's like taking a vitamin for the mind.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Some More Examples</h1>
<ul ><li >Settlers of Cataan can make you an astute businessman after a few games. You'll find yourself negotiating everything and saving/making money left and right.</li>
<li >Influence by Cialdini will give you a momentary force field against the tricks of pushy salespeople and also temporarily boost your own ability to get people to do what you want.</li>
<li >Watching Jersey Shore will temporarily make you feel much better about your life while at the same time altering your vocabulary with phrases like "You do you" and "GTL".</li></ul>
