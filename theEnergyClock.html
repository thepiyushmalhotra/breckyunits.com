<p class="scrollParagraph">Just as I sat down for my first meal in Nepal, the power went out.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I looked around. No one flinched.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>I guess it's fine</em>, I thought.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I finished my naan, handed over some cash and walked out.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It was quiet.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Power was out everywhere.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I turned down an alley and walked a few blocks.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Eventually I came out onto a new street, into a new world.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Power was on over here.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The streets were crowded.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The air buzzed with noise from people and motorbikes and machines.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I arrived at the hookah bar to meet my Nepali friend.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">We talked about college in America and blew smoke rings.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then the power went out.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Welcome to Kathmandu", she said.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Each neighborhood gets power for a few hours, then it rotates, like the hand on a clock".</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>

<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Kathmandu had a rotating energy clock.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Neighborhoods that were hustle and bustle one minute would be dead quiet the next.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It dawned on me that I had only been to cities with perpetually steady energy.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It had never even occurred to me that there could be anything different.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Kathmandu was different.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The energy clock affected each and every day.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">You made plans based on the energy clock.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Even the monkeys moved differently based on whether there was power or not.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">No one I knew seemed to know the complete story as to why the power was the way that it was.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">People just went on with their lives, unconscious as to how this rotating energy clock was subtlety affecting their plans.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">12 Years Later</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Last year, I took my final bite of naan. I tossed all candy. I said no to pizza.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was done eating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate">carbs</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I started eating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat">fats</a> instead.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was trying to get my body to phase change into "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis">ketosis</a>".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The theory is that you can eat a <a href="bipolarKeto.html">keto diet to manage bipolar disorder</a>.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Bipolar disorder is like having a rotating energy clock.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Some months you have energy. And then...it goes out.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Steady energy would be better.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I am six months into keto.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A few times a week, I prick my finger to measure the <a href="ketonesVsLithium.html">ketones in my blood</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By my calculations, it will take 3 years before I know for sure if keto can control my energy.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">So far, so good.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I strive to be an objective scientist. So I stay skeptical most of the time.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I allow myself a few moments to wonder...</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>What if keto works?</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><em>What if I no longer hear the ticking of the bipolar energy clock</em>?</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My whole life I've been tossed around by the movement of the bipolar energy clock.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It's hard to explain to people who have steady energy just <em>how much</em> the energy changes affect you.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The energy swings not only affect your activity levels, but they affect your decision making.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Risky leaps don't seem so risky when you have extra energy. And not taking big leaps, knowing that your power will soon go out, seems wasteful.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">When the power turned on, it was a mad rush to get as much done as possible, because I knew the energy wouldn't last.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Your understanding of the world fluctuates wildly.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I had no idea who or what was turning my power on and off.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I didn't know what "power" was.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I didn't even identify the bipolar pattern until my 20's.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Before that it was an unlabeled and unsolved mystery.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After that it was merely an unsolved mystery.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All my attempts to control it failed.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Maybe the gods decided who got power and for how long.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I tried to do good things when the power came to me, hoping the gods would reward me with a steady supply.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But energy would always come and then leave.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">With keto, the energy clock might be fixable.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The key drivers of bipolar energy cycles may have finally been identified by <a href="https://www.metabolicmind.org/">scientific workers</a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Mitochondria, ketones, glucose, ATP--these seem to be the key actors.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Could my years of alternating power surges and power outages be over?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Do people solve problems like this?</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Well, in Kathmandu they did.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://kathmandupost.com/money/2018/05/14/entire-country-is-now-free-of-loadshedding">In 2018 Nepal finally built a steady power supply.</a></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Workers fixed the Kathmandu energy clock.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Maybe workers can fix the bipolar energy clock too.</p>
