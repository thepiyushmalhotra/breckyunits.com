<p class="scrollParagraph">The boy looked up at the tree that was ten times taller than the others.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then he looked down and saw an old man sitting in a carved out stump next to the tree.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Excuse me mister, why is that tree so tall?" the boy asked.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Gray Beard explained the tree.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Do you understand?"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Yes. I understand," said the boy.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The boy turned around and walked out of the forest back to the city.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the city the boy met many people.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">One day a friend had a problem with her eye.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He helped her get the right medicine.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The boy decided to learn more about medicines.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He got a job selling medicines.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A few years later he had saved some money.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He returned to the forest and found Gray Beard sitting in his carved out stump by the tall tree.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He told Gray Beard about his experiences.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Gray Beard again explained the tree.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Ah! Now I understand," said the young man.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Back in the city the young man began helping people with their projects.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He put his savings into some of his favorite projects.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Years later, one project helped many people and he became rich.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He returned to the forest and found Gray Beard sitting in his carved out stump by the tall tree.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He told Gray Beard about his experiences.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Gray Beard again explained the tree.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Ah! Finally I understand," said the man.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He left the forest and went back to the city.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">In the city he took classes and went to parties and danced and fell in love.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A few years later he looked down at a beautiful crying baby.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He returned to the forest and found Gray Beard sitting in his carved out stump by the tall tree.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He told Gray Beard about his experiences.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Gray Beard again explained the tree.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The new father stood there.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Nothing was said.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He rubbed his own beard.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He left the forest and went back to the city.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Let us pack then," his wife said to him.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">They packed their bags and buckled up their children and drove to the forest.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Back in the forest he went to the tall tree.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The carved out stump was empty.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He walked for miles and miles in circles, looking for Gray Beard.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Eventually he became tired.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He sat down in the stump.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The breeze blew on his face and the birds chirped and the leaves rustled.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">He breathed in deeply.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Then he heard a child's voice.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">"Excuse me mister, why is that tree so tall?"</p>
