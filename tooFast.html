</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 5, 2024 ‚Äî </span>This morning on HackerNews a user posted a comment about a boring, niche product.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">However, I happened to work on that boring, niche product at Microsoft, and looked forward to having a constructive conversation about it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Instead I got the familiar cryptic error message:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">You're posting too fast. Please slow down. Thanks.</blockquote>

<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">The HackerNews Guidelines</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">HackerNews Guidelines</a> are a great read.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The Guidelines may be the wisest words assembled on running a constructive online community.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I like to reread them every few months.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Nowhere in the guidelines does it say anything about "posting too fast".</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The word "speed" does not appear at all.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What is the right speed?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">(I am genuinely curious.)</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Conflicting Advice</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I can't count the number of times YCombinator has said <em>FASTER!</em></p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For example, an <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/really.html">essay on PaulGraham.com</a> says:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">By this point everyone knows you should release fast and iterate. It's practically a mantra at YC...</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Fast iteration is the key to success.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I would estimate YCombinator has published <em>thousands</em> of posts and videos, explaining from <em>a hundred angles</em>, why you should move <em>faster</em>.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Apparently they have also discovered there is a "too fast":</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">You're posting too fast. Please slow down. Thanks.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For that discovery they give 8 words.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This is an interesting discovery! Tell us more!</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">A Question for the HackerNews Mods</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The HN Guidelines state:</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says...Assume good faith.</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The strongest plausible interpretation of that error message is that you have figured out something important: the optimal speed!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Can you please share with us, your dedicated users<a href="#note1" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, the answer to the question: <em>what is the right speed</em>?</p>

<p  id="note1"class="scrollParagraph"><a class="scrollFootNoteUsageLink" href="#noteUsage1">[1]</a> I was one of the first people to join HackerNews, creating my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=breck">current account</a> on August 24th, 2007, which is about eight months after <a href="analyzing-the-hacker-news-users-join-dates-karma-and-profiles.html">Paul Graham created it</a>.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Disclosure</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was part of two YCombinator batches, in 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">YCombinator expelled me in 2022<a href="#note2" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Of over 9,000 YCombinator alumni, I am the only founder who was part of both their #1 and #2 ranked batches (out of their ~37).</p>
<p  id="note2"class="scrollParagraph"><a class="scrollFootNoteUsageLink" href="#noteUsage2">[2]</a> I disagree with their expulsion and miss Bookface, the secret online forum they have for alums built originally by Garry Tan, but it's probably for the best. I am not yet sure whether I believe secret organized groups are a morally good thing. (Though I definitely miss pondering that moral question while utilizing the financially lucrative benefits of Bookface :) ).</p>
