</div>
<div class="scrollColumns" style="column-width:65ch;column-count:1;max-width:65ch;">
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">July 13, 2024 ‚Äî </span>I lived in San Francisco and Seattle in the 2000's and 2010's, and if I told you the names of every startup I almost joined as employee <5, you'd probably think I was lying.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I declined them all for the same reason: the 1 year vesting cliff.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">What's a cliff?</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If a startup gives you 1% of the company in the form of stock options, the standard is to vest 0.25% a year for 4 years with a 1 year cliff. This means you get nothing until after the first year.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you have to leave or they fire you after 11 months you own zero.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Cliffs are a bad deal for everyone and should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It sucks for the employees. It's so much more <strong>fun</strong> to do your best work immediately and never think about cliffs.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It sucks for the startups. They miss out on bringing in outlier talent who may stay for a decade, but only want to <em>guarantee</em> a few months.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Back in 2008-2018, I was young and 1 year seemed like an eternity-what if I wanted to travel in 10 months, or someone close to me got sick, or I had my own startup idea?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I also didn't want to have any incentive to sit on my best work until my shares started vesting. I wanted to give my teams my absolute best from day 1.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Historically I knew I would make the most impact at a startup in months 3 - 12, so why should I be rewarded less than the person who does just enough to last until month 12?</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Now that I'm an angel investor and not subject to cliffs, I can say with much higher certainty: cliffs are dumb and should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Four year vesting schedules are fine, but employees should vest daily, starting on day 1.</p>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">But what if we hire someone and they don't last even 1 month?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This should be very rare, but even if it happen, it's not a big deal.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">They get 2% of their stock options. Far less than a single percent of your company. So what.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Everyone should be happier without the cliff.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Presumably you've hired people who are <em>good people</em>, and so even though it wasn't a right fit, you think the world will be a better place if that person someday gets a little extra money from their stock.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">They also will forever be a booster of your business even though they are no longer an employee, because they now have the incentives to be.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 class="scrollQuestion">But what about all the paperwork, accounting, and legal trouble of daily vesting?</h4>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It is basic arithmetic. The software to implement this is dead simple. And I've now seen it done with one of the startups I invested in (and it works <em>great</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="dinkus"><span>*</span></div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">That's all I have to say about cliffs. Now, I've got to get back to building my own projects.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But if your startups wants to hire me and pay me in options, I am available. (For a month or two ;) )</p>
