<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 3, 2009 ‚Äî </span>What would happen if instead of writing about subjects you understood, you wrote about subjects you didn't understand? Let's find out!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Today's topic is linear algebra. I know almost nothing about vectors, matrices, and linear algebra.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I did not take a Linear Algebra course in college. Multivariable calculus may have done a chapter on vectors, but I only remember the very basics: it's a size with a direction, or something like that.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I went to a Borders once specifically to find a good book to teach myself linear algebra with. I even bought one that I thought was the most entertaining of the bunch. Trust me, it's far from entertaining. Haven't made it much further than page 10.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I bet vectors, matrices, and linear algebra are important. In fact, I'm <em>positive</em> they are. But I don't know why. I don't know how to apply linear algebra in everyday life, or if that's something you even do with linear algebra.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I use lots of math throughout the day such as:</p>
<ul ><li >Addition/subtraction when paying for things</li>
<li >Multiplication when cooking for 6 roommates</li>
<li >Probability when deciding whether to buy cell phone insurance</li>
<li >Calculus when thinking about the distance needed to break fast while biking</li>
<li >Exponents and logs when analyzing traffic graphs and programming</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But I have no idea when I should be using vectors, matrices, and other linear algebra concepts throughout the day.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">There are lots of books that teach <em>how</em> to do linear algebra. But are there any that explain <em>why</em>?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Would everyone benefit from linear algebra just as everyone would benefit from knowing probability theory? Would I benefit?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I don't know the answer to these questions. Fooled by Randomness revealed to me why probability is so incredibly important and inspired me to master it. Is there a similar book like that for linear algebra?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I guess when you write about what you don't know, you write mostly questions.</p>
