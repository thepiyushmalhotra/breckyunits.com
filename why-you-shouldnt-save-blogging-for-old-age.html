<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">December 9, 2009 ‚Äî </span>A lot of people have the idea that maybe one day they'll become rich and famous and then write a book about it. That's probably because it seems like the first thing people do after becoming rich and famous is write a book about it.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">But you don't have to wait until you're rich and famous to write a book about your experiences and ideas.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">A few months ago I was talking to another MBA student, a very talented man, about 30 years old from a great school with a great resume. I asked him what he wanted to do for his career, and he replied that he wanted to go into a particular field, but thought he should work for McKinsey for a few years first to add to his resume. <b>To me that's like saving sex for your old age</b>. It makes no sense.

@ Warren Buffet</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Likewise, saving blogging for your old age makes no sense. There are two selfless reasons why you should start blogging now:</p>
<ol  start="1."><li >You may enlighten someone.</li>
<li >Sharing your experiences adds another data point to our collective knowledge and makes us all better off.</li></ol>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It used to take a lot of work to publish something. Now it is simpler than brushing your teeth. So publish, write, blog!</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If you need some selfish reasons, here are 5:</p>
<ol  start="1."><li >Writing is good exercise for the brain and gives you "writer's high".</li>
<li >Blogging makes you a better writer.</li>
<li >When your blog gets traffic, it stokes your ego.</li>
<li >You may spark interesting conversations with interesting people.</li>
<li >In rare circumstances, you may make money.</li></ol>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Blogging. Don't save it for your old age.</p>
