<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">April 5, 2024 — </span>Have you ever examined the correlation between your writing behavior and sleep?</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I've written some things in my life that make me cringe. I might cringe because I see some past writing was naive, mistaken, locked-in, overconfident, unkind, insensitive, aggressive, or grandiose.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I now have a pretty big dataset to identify my secret trick to write more cringe: less sleep.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For this post I combined 2,500 nights of sleep data with 58 blog posts. A 7 year experiment to see how sleep affects my writing.</p>

</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 12, 2024 — </span>For decades I had a bet that worked in good times and bad: time you invest in word skills easily pays for itself via increased value you can provide to society. If the tide went out for me I'd pick up a book on a new programming language so that when the tide came back in I'd be better equipped to contribute more. I also thought that the more society invested in words, the better off society would be. New words and word techniques from scientific research helped us invent new technology and cure disease. Improvements in words led to better legal and commerce and diplomatic systems that led to more justice and prosperity for more people. My read on history is that it was words that led to the start of civilization, words were our present, and words were our future. <strong>Words were the safe bet</strong>.</p><a class="scrollContinueReadingLink" href="wordsAreWorseThanWeights.html">Continue reading...</a></div>

It is even worse than I thought. Trying to write a narrative of one's own life in the traditional way is impossible. I am writing a narrative of my past year and realized while there is a single thread about <strong>where</strong> my body was and <strong>what</strong> I was doing there are <em>multiple</em> independent threads explaining the <strong>why</strong>.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">This takes practice and there aren't a lot of shortcuts.</p>

<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Set a thin column width in your editor</blockquote>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Mine is 36 characters (your ideal width may be different).</p>

<p class="scrollParagraph">I've been reading the newspaper everyday since I was a kid. I remember I'd have my feet on the ground, my body tilted at an angle and my body weight pressed into the pages on the counter. I remember staring intently at the pages spread out before me. World news, local news, sports, business, comics. I remember the smell of the print. The feel of the pages. The ink that would be smeared on my forearms when I finished reading and stood back up straight. Scroll has none of that. But it does at least have the same big single page layout.</p><a class="scrollContinueReadingLink" href="scroll-beta.html">Continue reading...</a></div>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 23, 2020 — </span>People make biased claims all the time. A decent response used to be "citation needed". But we should demand more. Anytime someone makes a claim that seems biased, call them out with: <strong><em>Dataset needed</em></strong>.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Whether it's an academic paper, news article, blog post, tweet, comment or ad, linking to analyses is not enough. If someone stops at that, demand a link to a clean dataset supporting the author's position. If they can't deliver, they should retract.</p><a class="scrollContinueReadingLink" href="dataset-needed.html">Continue reading...</a></div>

I think stories always oversimplify things, have hindsight bias, and often mislead. I spend a lot of time trying to invent tools for making data derived thinking as effortless as narrative thinking (so far, mostly in vain). And yet, as much as I rail on stories, I have to admit stories work.</p>

I spend a lot of time using TextMate. For the past year I've been using TextMate to write a program that now consists of a few hundred files. There are thousands of words in this program. There are hundreds of objects and concepts and functions that each have a name. The names are super simple like "Pen" for an object that draws on the screen, and "delete" for a method that deletes something. Some of the things in our program are more important than others and those really important ones I've renamed dozens of times searching for the right fit.</p><a class="scrollContinueReadingLink" href="naming-things.html">Continue reading...</a></div>
